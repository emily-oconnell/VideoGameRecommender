The character will die if you touch them.  \n  \nHere is the link to the game : https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id\u003dcom.heethpjain.heeth.flappygravity  \n  \nHope so you like my game!  \nPlease leave an honest rating!  \nI won\u0027t ask anyone for fake ratings!  \n  \nAnd suggestions are highly appreciated!",

However, his plans are foiled when his childhood friend Iyo, who turns out to be a zashiki-warashi, introduces herself, looking exactly the same as he remembers her from over a decade ago. Then, a woman named Kikyou, who claims to be a demon, also appears before him. After that, it isn\u0027t long before a pretty detective at the police department comes knocking on his door, imploring him to take up his family\u0027s duty of helping wandering spirits pass on to the afterlife and assist the police with any and all supernatural crimes reported in town. But when a case that\u0027s bigger than any of them ever imagined comes his way, will he be able to handle it? With the power of clairvoyance, an ability passed down through his family that allows him to see spirits, maybe he and his demon familiars can pull through, and he can be a proper successor to his family\u0027s legacy.",

Since then they have waited, counting the days as the city falls into ruin. \n\nAtto was only eight years old when his body was encased in metal. He remembers nothing of the time before. He only knows that someone must have given him his beautiful pocket watch, and a restless urge to fix things. \n\nMilli is a masterpiece of mechanical ingenuity. She has detailed knowledge of the workings of Watchtower. And more importantly: of time itself. Yet, she knows nothing of her origins, except that she was meant for a great purpose.",

    "summary": "Spy vs. Spy: The Island Caper \nSpy vs. Spy: The Island Caper (also known as Spy vs. Spy II: The Island Caper)[8] introduced a side scrolling play area, which effectively allowed for a small number of very wide \"rooms\" (the action actually takes place outside, on a tropical island).[7] It also introduced the idea of traps being built from the sticks and coconuts on the island, meaning that each spy no longer started with a fixed number of traps, but must compete to acquire the raw materials necessary to build their traps. The spies must gather the three segments of a rocket and then dive into a sea where a submarine awaits them. However, only connected segments can be carried at any one time. The second installment also included more complex scenery and continued the dual-screen interface present in the first.[7] The game starts with the two players parachuting onto an island in search of a buried missile. As they search, players are able to build traps to slow their enemy\u0027s progress.[7] This game was going to come out on the NES in North America from Kemco but was scrapped because of poor sales of the first game on NES, but in 2009 reproductions of the game in cartridge form were released in both regular and black and white limited edition cartridges.",

The occupants of this warehouse include a kindly looking old doctor, and a man with a notable scar on his face. Mika arrives, and the man with the scar claims the contents of the case: two massive handguns. That man is revealed to be the game\u0027s title character Grave, and now that he is armed he can start his mission.  \n  \nGungrave first approaches its stages as a series of missions issued by Dr. T, first to gather information on the current makeup of Millennion from a low-level street gang, and next destroying a research facility that creates Harry\u0027s undead soldiers. In the third stage, while attempting to pump information from an informant, Grave comes into contact with the leadership of the Millenion organization—once friends and allies that he now faces as enemies. Each have used the research Harry supported to give themselves inhuman powers. From here on, Grave is hounded by each member as he makes his way to Harry\u0027s tower at the heart of the city.",

The Dominion of Rubrum uses the Vermillion Bird Crystal, which controls magic; the Milites Empire controls the White Tiger Crystal, containing the power of science and weapons; the Kingdom of Concordia uses the Azure Dragon Crystal, containing the power of Dragons; and the Lorican Alliance is home to the Black Tortoise Crystal, containing the power of shielding. Each nation has an academy, or Peristylium, to research and protect the country\u0027s respective crystal. The crystals have the ability to mark humans as their countries\u0027 servants. These servants, called l\u0027Cie, are branded with a symbol and are given a \"Focus\", a task to complete. While blessed with long life and the ability to transform into crystal, l\u0027Cie are cursed to lose their memories over time. The people of Orience also lose their memories of the dead, so they will not be held back by any past regrets and continue strengthening their souls through conflict, a mechanism put in place by the crystals for the convenience of the deities who crafted them. The main aim of many characters is to become Agito, a legendary figure who will appear and save the world from Tempus Finis, an apocalyptic event that will destroy Orience.",

They first use the toys to stop the alien General Skun-ka\u0027pe from destroying the city, who has come to Earth to seek out the Toys himself, and banish him back to the Penal Zone- an interdimensional prison that he escaped previously to the episode. During this mission, the Freelance Police encounter a cult of Mole Men who have been watching over a mysterious artifact called the Devil\u0027s Toybox that has been sitting in the basement of Sam and Max\u0027s office for quite some time. By watching some dusty film reels, they learn that their great-grandparents, Sameth and Maximus, were chosen by the cryptic Mr. Papierwaite to retrieve the Toybox from the Tomb of Sammun-Mak, an ancient Pharaoh. However, when they successfully recovered it, Papierwaite attempted to use Maximus\u0027 psychic powers and the Toybox to summon the Elder God, Yog-Soggoth, and bring about the end of the world. Sameth and Maximus managed to stop Mr. Papierwaite by tricking him into saying the summoning words himself and then tasked the Mole Men of the time with watching the Toybox in the basement under their office building (they were supposed to help, too, but were unintentionally killed by a protection spell).",

    "summary": "Behold disciples of Nod, for the end is soon upon us. Electronic Arts’ award-winning and best-selling Tiberium saga is coming to a powerful conclusion with Command \u0026 Conquer 4, which will introduce a multitude of innovations to the classic fast and fluid Command \u0026 Conquer gameplay, while retaining the core compulsions that fans have come to love over the series’ history.\n\nIt is the year 2062 and humanity is at the brink of extinction. Tiberium, the mysterious, alien crystalline structure that has infested Earth for decades and served as the primary reason for years of relentless conflict between the Global Defense Initiative (GDI) and the Brotherhood of Nod, is close to rendering the planet uninhabitable. Mankind is on the verge of extinction when Kane, Nod’s prophetic leader, emerges from seclusion to deliver GDI the message that he has developed a system that could control Tiberium and harness its power. But he cannot build this \"Tiberium Control Network\" without GDI’s cooperation. Thus, the two opposing factions – GDI and Nod – inevitably find themselves in desperation for the same cause: to stop Tiberium from extinguishing mankind.\n\nAfter 15 years, the network is nearly complete, Tiberium is under strict control and our revitalized, newly terraformed planet is on the cusp of a new age of prosperity and progress. It is then that the world’s citizens begin to seriously ponder why Kane chose to help, and what will he want in return. These questions and more lead to the dramatic final act of the Tiberium saga.\n\nWith a multitude of innovative new features to the fast and fluid C\u0026C gameplay, Command \u0026 Conquer 4 offers players an entirely new way to play C\u0026C. An all-in-one mobile base, persistent player progression across all game modes that is constantly updated in a real-time online profile, a 3-class system for each of the two factions, co-operative play, and a 5v5 objective-based multiplayer mode that promotes teamwork and social interaction, make Command \u0026 Conquer 4 unlike any other C\u0026C experience.",

The Tandor region is known for its gym challenge: to qualify, trainers must collect 8 gym badges from around the region in order to compete in the prestigous Tandor Regional Tournament. Trainers that win the Tournament get a huge prize as well as world wide renown.\n\nYou, a 13-year-old kid from Moki Town, did not set out to become a Pokemon Master. After your mother Lucille died ten years ago in an accident at a nuclear power plant, your father Kellyn, the top Pokemon Ranger in the Tandor Ranger Union, left you with your elderly aunt and departed to travel the region. But now that you are grown up, your aunt can no longer support you. Out of a home, you did what most kids your age do and took up Pokémon training as a means to make a living.\n\nProfessor Bamb\u0027o, regional expert on Pokémon elements, has been looking for a trainer assistant to travel the region and gather specimens of the varied wildlife. You step up to the challenge, along with your rival, a younger boy named Theo. After taking a test and receiving your starter Pokémon, you head towards your first gym challenge in Nowtoch city, and take your first steps exploring the Tandor region.\n\nThings aren\u0027t as sunny as they first seem, though. Just when the accident ten years ago had been all but forgotten, new mysteries emerge. A new power plant is built over the site of the old one. Your father begins acting strangely, journeying to the far reaches of the region and questioning whether your mother is really deceased. Sinister Pokemon, corrupted by nuclear radiation, threaten innocent people. In the midst ofthe turmoil, it seems that an impending disaster is looming over Tandor... You may be in for more than you expected.",

To control the goalkeeper, the player to the left has to use the up-left and down-left directions of the joystick. To control the middle fielders, the player uses the up and down directions. To control the attackers, the player uses the up-right and down-right directions. The opposite applies to the right player. \n \nThe ball stops each time it touches a moving foosman and rebounds if it touches a still one. The score is marked with \"/\" (for one point) and \"X\" (for two points) symbols. The game ends when one of the players reaches ten points (XXXXX).",

The scoring rack is at the bottom. \n \nThe left hand control controls the goalkeeper at the left side of the screen and the other members of the team who wear the same colors. \n \nThe right hand control controls the goalkeeper at the right side of the screen as well as the other members of the team. \n \nYou can play against another player or the computer. Press the action button or move the joystick of the hand control to tell the computer how many people are in the game. If one of the hand controls is not activated, the computer will play that side and a \"C\" will appear on the scoring rack. If neither hand control is activated, the computer will play itself. \n \nEach joystick controls three sets of electronic lightning rods that maneuver the ranks of players. \n \nPush the joystick of the left hand control to the left to control the goalkeeper. When the joystick is in the center position, it will control the center file of three team members. When the joystick is in the far right position, it will control the file of two team members on the right side of your screen. For the right hand control, the reverse is true. \n \nThe ball will come into play from the bottom of the screen. \n \nThe ball will stop when it hits a player and the joystick is controlling the player\u0027s row. To kick, press the action button and simultaneously move the joystick in the direction you wish the ball to go. \n \nThe ball will rebound off a player whose row is not under control of the joystick. \n \nWhen a goal is scored, a ring will slide along the scoring rack at the bottom of the screen. /\u003d1 point.

You fill all available spaces with all the available shapes to solve each one. We have focused on simplifying the role of placing pieces so there is no moving pieces into place and clicking buttons to rotate and flip. Instead, you use your mouse to draw them into place, while drawing over an already present shape will remove it. It\u0027s a very simple mechanic which anyone can easily understand. The story of the game revolves around the evil but slightly incompetent Astroslugs who strife to leave their home planet and conquer the universe. Their only problem: They have no source of energy to jumpstart their space craft. Now they turn to you to fix this problem and get them on their way to the stars.",

You\u0027ll find out soon enough, just try not to die first!\nYour puny squad is capable of much more. Choose your loot and transform the squishy humans into wizards, cultists, ninjas and dozens of other heroes, including the mythical stale pretzel throwers. With perks and class combos, there are thousands of ways to build your army. The man-eating cabbage will appreciate the variety in its diet!\nIf you can survive the labyrinth, you\u0027ll meet THE UNSTOPPABLE END-GAME BUILDS OF OTHER PLAYERS! You\u0027ll beat each other to death and only one will be spared by d\u0027Spot. No offense, but in his own game he writes the rules!\nPrepare your warriors and let them fight it out on their own! Indirect combat allows you to focus heavily on tactical considerations rather than reflexes. Strengthen your front line with fridge-movers, aim your food-throwers and look after your Forbidden Summoners!",

The idea is to kill the monster to unlock the exit to escape. However the monster is extremely hard to hit and moves at lightning fast speed. If you do nothing \"Choke\" will bite you to death in seconds. Killing the monster allows the exit switch to raise from the ground, but due to a bug the level can be exited at any time. Originally the WAD used DEHACKED to create the monster but was updated with DECORATE support. \n \n \nThe Ghoul\u0027s Forest was intended as a small joke to scare a handful of players. However it gained enough attention, when it was uploaded to idgames, to gain a sequel.",

Your path lead you through randomly generated post-apocalyptic areas controlled by different enemy factions with brutal leaders and shelters occupied by infected creatures.\n\nYou have to use your skills in a fast paced, violent and complex 2D brawler-like combat where lots of firearms and melee weapons are waiting for you to beat and execute your enemies. You will unlock new weapons, clothes, skills, relics and RPG-like character improvements during your journey.\"",

Singleplayer and co-op for up to four players.\n\nEvery run is different because of the randomly generated content. By beating enemies players can loot more than 150 different blueprints of permanent improvements and this is the key to Infected Shelter\u0027s replayability. Instead of just collecting loot to make yourself more powerful during a single run, you unlock new weapons, clothes, skills, relics and RPG-like character improvements that change how you play the game in the following runs.\"",

The first is a side view dogfight between your ship and some hapless enemies that are trying to home in on it. Things heat up in the second (and far more common) type of screen, which consists of Defender-style action minus the humanoids. You\u0027re required to shoot a specific number of aliens, then pass through a gate to the next stage. \n \nLike Defender, aliens come in all shapes and sizes, and have varying attack patterns. Some of them shoot at you, some bounce, but all the action is a far cry faster than Defender. Once all the aliens are destroyed, you must pass through an electro gate that zaps in certain patterns--failing this forces you to repeat the current level without scoring any points. After at least three Defender style screens, it\u0027s back to the dogfight. Subterranea awards extra lives not by scoring, but by completing stages without being hit. while Subterranea borrows concepts from other games and doesn\u0027t appear to be very original, there\u0027s just something about it that keeps you coming back for yet another game.",

Due to your power supply being damaged, you have to make a path while picking up spare batteries along the way. Once you make a path that makes it to the exit, you switch to the 3D Action phase and protect your robot companion who provides you energy as you both fight your way through the corridors.",
