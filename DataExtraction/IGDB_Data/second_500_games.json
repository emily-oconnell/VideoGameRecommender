    "summary": "Ghostlop is a Matching Puzzle game, developed and published by Data East, which was released in Japan in 1996. \n \nGhostlop is a head-to-head arcade style puzzle game featuring a unique mix of elements from Puzzle Bobble and Breakout, with a color-switching mechanic reminiscent of Silhouette Mirage and Ikaruga. \n \nYou aim shots the same way as in Puzzle Bobble, but there are only two main colors of bubbles to destroy--or in this case ghosts. The A and B buttons determine whether your shot is red or blue. If your shot is the same color as the ghosts it hits, it will cut through them like in a bonus level of Alleyway. If it\u0027s the opposite color, it will bounce off without doing damage. You can switch as often as you like (even while the ball is bouncing around) so if there are a lot of red ghosts surrounded by a layer of blue ghosts, you could detach all of them from the top of the screen by throwing a blue shot to pass through the outer layer, switching to red to move through the middle, and then switching back to blue to pass out the other side, dropping the majority of the ghosts and putting a lot of garbage on your opponent\u0027s screen. As your ball bounces around you\u0027re free to move your character back and forth along the bottom of the screen, and you need to catch the ball when it comes back or suffer the penalty of having the pieces lower one notch. \n \nThe action is fast-paced and smooth. The lighthearted characters and rockabilly music add a lot of charm that is missing from newer puzzle games like Lumines and Planet Puzzle League.",

The player must also evade dangers and traps such as rotating saws or falling debris. \n \nDuring combat, the game allows the player to switch between gun combat and hand-to-hand combat. The player has a range of melee attacks that can be used against enemies, and can also evade the attacks of enemies. Gun combat features a lock-on system, and the player can use either pistols, shotguns or tommy guns. The game also includes puzzle-solving, in the form of hieroglyphic decoding.Additional unlockables, such as concept art, can be obtained by collecting artifacts hidden throughout the levels.",

You know the whacked-out, time-warped trip we had in the movie. Now, in the Bill \u0026 Ted\u0027s Most Excellent computer game, you\u0027ll meet some neat dead dudes, too- though you\u0027ll need more than two to pass that most heinous history exam!\n\nAt the Circle K, meet Rufus, an ultra-cool messenger and his time traveling phone booth. Just dial a year and take off in time. You\u0027re looking for a bodacious bunch of historical heavyweights to bring back to San Dimas High. This is an excellent arcade / action adventure, but only the coolest of dudes will be triumphant!\n\nCan you find the answer for Socrates the philoso-fizer, take notes for Beethoven, fiddle with Nero and chill out with Joan of Arc (she\u0027s one hot chick, but it\u0027s \"Miss of Arc\" to you)? No way?! Yes, way! Genghis Khan likes Twinkies and Marie Antoinette is into cake, but how do you get Freud to leave his mother and get Mikey (Michaelangelo) off the ceiling? Don\u0027t forget that short, dead dude Napoleon, and there\u0027s Abe Lincoln and Billy the Kid. Plus, Uncle Al (relativ-ity) wanders randomly- hey, he\u0027s Einstein, whatcha gonna do!\n\nThe animation and graphics are incredible. There\u0027s stuff digitized right outta the movie and some really neat sounds. Whoa! There\u0027s even four levels of difficulty to make this totally not easy.\n\nSo be excellent to yourself and buy this computer game. Party on, dudes!",

After each difficulty mode play-thru it offers an unlock which gives incentive to return to the ocean depths one more time on a higher difficulty setting. \n \nThe game offers full controller support with Xbox(360/One), and Dualshock 4 controllers which is the recommended way to play the game. Keyboard controls are also available although not recommended way to play. Each level has it\u0027s own chiptune soundtrack with the exception of the boss battles.",

    "summary": "Experience the dramatic intensity of the frontlines of a war through the eyes of the first of a new breed of super soldiers in this gritty and epic first-person action game. An augmented super-soldier must stop a renegade regime from eradicating the civilized world.  \n \nHong Kong, 2065. 2nd Lt. Nathan Frost is just a regular grunt in an international army called the Liberty Coalition. When he takes massive injuries from an explosion on the battlefield, Frost undergoes an experimental procedure. The outcome of the surgery is something more than human; a transformation that makes him a unique weapons-grade warrior, with abilities that far surpass those of the average soldier.  \n \nEmpowered with these extra-normal abilities via implanted augmentations, Frost is immediately sent to the frontlines of a war as a secret weapon against the destructive regime. Stranded in hostile territory, cut off from command and far outnumbered, Frost and a handful of men must try and stop the entire renegade militia\u0027s plan threatening to plunge the world into darkness.",

    "storyline": "Welcome to Zero Zone. A region once flourishing and vibrant, now devastated and deserted. The day Perunium – a previously unknown, superconductive element – was discovered in the area marked the fast and inevitable collapse of the entire territory. Governments and corporations seeking a new source of income started uncontrolled extraction of this new element, completely ignoring the harm the purification process was having on the environment. Once the ruling powers were done and forbade further Perunium acquisition, every citizen was evacuated from the area and the land was declared neutral and left ruined. \n \nLife abhors a vacuum, however, so it didn’t take long for the first illegal miners to appear – and it took even less time for a quiet war between the main economic powers to start. Of course, officially, none of this was happening and none of the previous Perunium beneficiaries were there. In the end, the government couldn’t lose the rest of its credibility by admitting they’ve completely lost control over what’s happening in the Zone. Nothing was going on there according to the news – no bloodshed, and only a couple of random punks breaking the “keep away” order. Journalists belittled the whole thing, reporting “zero killed”. Case closed. Scavengers who remained in the Zone started calling themselves “Zeros”: people whose lives are a dime a dozen, their deaths not even counted as casualties. \n \nA few years later, only professional Zeros remain in the Zone – people who have abandoned their past and broke any contact with former employers. You take the role of one of them. You are one of the Zeros.",
    "summary": "Zero Killed is a tactical multiplayer VR shooter that mixes Rainbow Six Siege’s tactical gameplay, Counter-Strike’s engaging PvP multiplayer, and SWAT 4’s rich choice of equipment and gadgets with a dash of sci-fi. All put into VR with unrestricted movement and an advanced collision system for full immersion.",

Each player is in a hurry to be like the first and get rid of all their cards. At the same time from level to level the reaction rate of rivals increases and it will be harder for you to win. \nAs in any other game, much depends on your luck.

    "storyline": "Shindou Nikita has a secret that he has been hiding for a long time—he loves hentai and h-games. He enters \"The Alternative Trivia Research Club\" where the first of his many sexual encounters takes place. Despite that, he finds out that both of his foster sisters are in love with him, and he has to make a choice—who does he really love. Nikita Shindou loves the world of animation more than anything; he puts his life into it. He has never fallen for a real, living girl, until the day he meets Ren Aoi. \n \nWe\u0027re introduced to young man Nikita Shindou as he\u0027s making his way through Akihabara, which is his main haunt and the place where he gets all his bishōjo games, which he plays in his room all alone in the dark. Keeping them a secret from his sister who just moved in a few months ago after their parents had died, Nikita loves playing up the characters having sex with each other and manipulating them as he can. To his surprise on his way home though, he comes across a park he hadn\u0027t remembered before and sees a beautiful woman there, one that reminds him strikingly of an older Sheeta from Laputa: Castle in the Sky! Even more amazing is that she comes into his room in some sort of dream sequence not too much later and keeps calling him Pazu and the two fool around quite a bit only for it to end up as a dream.",

Lele, his dog friends, Cat King and the cats form an alliance to fight and defend their hometown. \n \nTun Town is a Chinese-made role-playing game. The gameplay system is similar to that of Japanese-style RPGs, with party management, simple turn-based battles, and automatic leveling up. It is possible to collect parts to build different kinds of weapons in the game. The visuals are cartoon-like, and the plot has humorous elements.",

    "summary": "Mr. Wimpy is a platforming video game released by Ocean Software in 1984. The game was intended to be a promotional tie with Wimpy restaurants as their logos, company mascots, and theme tunes were reproduced. The game was released on the Oric 1, ZX Spectrum, BBC Micro and Commodore 64. The gameplay is similar to the video game BurgerTime.[1] \n \nGameplay[edit] \nAt the start of the game, Mr. Wimpy has to cross his kitchen while avoiding moving manholes to get to the larder so that he can collect ingredients and make his burgers. As an added hazard, a character called Waldo tries and steal these ingredients from him.[2] After the opening level, the game becomes a traditional platform game where the player must guide Mr. Wimpy across the platforms while walking over four various burger ingredients, which in turn causes them to crash to the platform below and finally to the four plates at the bottom.[2] Mr. Wimpy must also avoid various enemies in the guise of walking sausages, eggs, pickles, and spoons. Players have the ability to spray pepper at the enemies, which temporarily freezes them for a few seconds, allowing players to escape.[2] Enemies can also be trapped and squashed by walking over burger ingredients while they are on the level below.[3] \n \nThe platform portion of the game features the following enemies: Sid Sos (a walking sausage), Ogy Egg (a walking fried egg), Sam Spoon (a walking spoon), and Pam Pickle (a walking pickle).[3] As the player progresses in the game, more enemies are added.[citation needed] Mr. Wimpy\u0027s only defences against the enemies are to either trap them between the falling burger ingredients or to temporarily freeze them with pepper.[citation needed] However, players can only a small supply of pepper at any given time (4 bottles could be carried).[2] Players can pick up coffee cups or ice creams that appear on the screen (when they are down to their last pepper pot), rewarding them with an extra pepper pot.[2] Players are given four lives at the start of the game, any of which can be lost in the opening Larder level by falling down a moving pothole or by getting caught by an enemy in the platform portion of the game.[citation needed]",
