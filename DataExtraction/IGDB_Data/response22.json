The game is a classic interactive-fiction game, with a text parser as the sole user interface. It was developed using a contemporary toolkit (Adventure Game Toolkit v1.3). \n \nYou are playing a young man named Mim. Like all inhabitants of Xanth, Mim has a unique magical ability, the so-called talent. In his case he is able to conjure a magical mirror which can then be used to talk to any person he wants to, regardless of distance to that person. His talent makes him a quite important member of his local community, the Gap village. He serves as the villages\u0027 liaison to King Trent the ruler of the lands of Xanth, who resides in castle Roogna. Mim regularly corresponds with the King discussing various matters. This serves as the starting point for your adventure, as the latest communication with the King will result into a mission given to Mim.",

The protagonist, a young man named Masato, decides to venture into the dangerous zone and rescue the beauties. \n \nExterlien has turn-based battles against monsters, but it cannot be qualified as an RPG due to the extreme simplicity of the combat. The player should simply figure out which attack damages the monster most. There are no experience points, physical exploration, money, equipment, or any other essential RPG elements. The core gameplay is that of a Japanese menu-driven adventure: choose which location to go to, select the best attacks against a monster, be rewarded with erotic (very \"softcore\") images of the rescued girls.",

Some are futuristic, some are ancient, and some are medieval. A few evoke platform games such as sonic, others follow a style more akin to diablo. Some are static maps, others are randomly connected. \n \nThere is something to fit your mood. There are mutators that can add mounted weapons in any map, buildings, monsters, foliage, hazards, and even balloons and bumpers. You can fight with futuristic weapons, medieval weapons, and /or hand to hand combat. There are also many vehicles (and a mutator to spawn them in maps that do not have them, as is tradition (as you can see)). \n \nYou can also set each team to start with different specific weapons if you want to test a theory that you could defeat a well equipped military force with your bolt action rifle or crossbow. Same with vehicles and mounted weapons spawning (you can set which spawn near which team in CTF etc). You can drink wine, potions, learn magic, read scrolls, so on and so forth. \n \nThe goal, and much of this has been reached, is to not limit the player.",

Upon the player\u0027s command, the player may switch his mount into a tiger and attack with his mace. Within each stage, there are also power-ups that allow the player to morph into a laser breathing dragon for a limited period of time. \n \nThe player\u0027s life bar is represented by a fire breathing dragon in the upper corner. With each hit the player takes, the fire breath grows smaller. Once the life bar is depleted the player\u0027s mount is killed and the player travels on foot and fights with throwing daggers. If hit in this form then the player loses a life. The game is over when all of a players lives are lost.",

The object of the game is to throw a plasma ball into a round goal that is suspended above the middle of a hockey-sized arena. Before you or your computer opponent can make a basket, the ball must be charged. Each team\u0027s charger is located in their opponents end of the court. Be careful, though: If the ball is charged with your opponent\u0027s color and you make a basket, your opponent gets the points. The same rule applies for the opposing team. There are different zones on the court and depending on where a player is standing when he makes a shot, he will score one, two, or three points. \n \nThere are sixteen different teams to choose from, representing the countries of England, France, the United States, Germany, Japan, Mexico, Australia, and Russia. Each team has four players on the court at once. Most of the action consists of passing, shooting, and stealing the ball, punching and sliding into your opponents, and a whole lot of running.",

Every character has unlimited guard, a move that can not be blocked, as well as a super move. The game also features a variety of alternative clothing items and weapons for all the characters that can be used to edit their models.\n\nThe game includes a single-player story mode, a multiplayer mode, and an Extras mode which is unlocked after finishing the storyline. As opposed to the first Battle Raper, the sequel actually does not feature rape but only consensual sex. Once a fight against a female character is won, the game enters a special mode where the unconscious woman lies on the ground in front of the player who now has to heal her wounds. The Replay mode allows the player to have sex with a chosen female character.",

In the game, players fly a F-14 Tomcat jet fighter, gunning down enemies while avoiding incoming fire. Like OutRun, another Sega arcade game, After Burner II came in several versions, the most famous being a large, servo actuated, sit-down cabinet which resembled a cockpit and moved according to the motion of the plane onscreen. The cockpit would bank in the same direction the on-screen aircraft was banking. There was also a more basic upright cabinet version. \n \nAfter Burner II has been translated and ported to numerous home computers, consoles and mobile phones; including versions for the PC Engine, Sharp X68000, Sega Mega Drive, Famicom, FM Towns Marty, Atari ST, Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and Sega Saturn. In Japan, it was released on the PlayStation 2 as part of the Sega Ages classic series. Mega placed the Mega Drive version at #38 in their Top Mega Drive Games of All Time. MegaTech magazine praised the smooth and fast gameplay, as well as the sound.",

    "storyline": "Taking place in the 1940s, the game puts the player in control of a rookie government agent, Jim Pearson, whose first case involves investigating Nazi propaganda. The case is not as simple as it sounds, however. Before long, Jim uncovers information and evidence that the Nazis have connections to the supernatural, occultism as well as some very bizarre and ritualistic killings. Jim meets Elizabeth Short who possesses a strange engraved stone known as the \"Black Dahlia\", an artifact coveted by the Nazis as a source of ultimate power. When her brutal murder occurs, the stone disappears. During Jim\u0027s search for the missing item, he uncovers a web of evil, deceit and intrigue. Will he get out alive .. and uncorrupted?",
    "summary": "Black Dahlia is a suspense thriller based loosely on the unsolved California murder of Elizabeth Short, nicknamed \"Black Dahlia\" for her favoritism towards black clothing. \n\nThe game is a point-and-click puzzle-solving adventure with live action cutscenes. Full 360 degree horizontal and limited vertical panning allow the player to scan each scene with the mouse. Jim\u0027s in-game notebook acts as a journal as it records everything of importance that he has examined.\n\nBlack Dahlia has over sixty puzzles dispersed over nearly as many locations. They range in difficulty, style and type including jigsaw, manipulation, code breaking, mazes and object based. Well publicized bypass codes can be used to \"auto-solve\" them without compromising the game, since no score is kept.",

There are five ships in a row and they slowly begin descending down the screen. Each ship has a maths problem written on it and to shoot it down the player has to enter the correct answer for the ship above him. The player is destroyed if any ship reaches the bottom. The game otherwise runs for a fixed time which can be customized by the player. Other customization options include skill level (1 to 9) and problem range (3, 6 or 9).",

Whether using stealth or a more direct approach, players will need to use their strategic thinking and use both basic and advanced weaponry while facing many different opponents - ranging from unorganized local militia to smart and skilled mercenaries. \n \nWith highly replayable missions, achievements, weapons to unlock and whole campaigns to be regularly added, Arma Tactics offers many hours of intense ever-changing action.",

You are a merchant in northern Europe in the late Middle Ages when the Hanseatic League was flourishing. Your goal is to rise to the most successful and influential member of the Hanse, ultimately being elected Elderman, leader of the trading league. You start bargaining with common goods, build up your own production and establish a merchant fleet. Later on, you will gain more and more political influence and even found new towns.\nHowever, a Hanse merchant\u0027s life can also have its dark sides. On your way to power you have to hold your ground against fierce rivals, whom you have to fight with economic competition, price wars or impure means such as sabotage. Will you even engage in piracy?",

This offers four new characters (Imagawa Yoshimoto, Hashiba Hideyoshi, Honda Tadakatsu and Inahime) and a brand new mission and map. This also offers new weapons, items, skills, three new versus modes, a new survival mode, and fixes several problems. A new difficulty level, Novice is also added which is easier than Easy and targeted for beginners. Exclusive to Samurai Warriors Xtreme Legends, through the completion of special tasks, the player can earn Bonus Points in order to purchase special features. These features include additional costumes for characters, voice sound tests, lowering the difficulty required to unlock the fifth and sixth weapons and the ability to break the default limits for character\u0027s stats. Methods of earning bonus points include the following: earning all of a character\u0027s endings, unlocking rare items and weapons and successfully creating new characters.",

It seems that the powerful elemental spirits have been troubling the Shapeir folk recently. Something, or someone, is behind those troubles. It is the hero\u0027s task to find out what is going on, get acquainted with the many inhabitants of Shapeir, and prove once more that he is worthy of his heroic title.\n\nLike its predecessor, Trial by Fire is a hybrid game that incorporates elements from adventure and role-playing genres. It has a text-based interface, puzzles to solve, inventory items, characters to talk to, as well as pure RPG elements such as character growth system and battles. Player character can be either a fighter, a thief, or a wizard, and can also become a paladin during the course of the game if he follows a strict moral code.\n\nReal-time combat is presented on separate screens and offers more options than the previous title. There are several types of high, mid-level, and low attacks, as well as parrying and dodging. The hero raises his combat proficiency and other skills by fighting enemies, training, and performing various actions that influence the corresponding parameters.",

In a homage to James Bond, S.P.Y. Special Project Y has a variety of game styles over various levels which need completing to complete your mission. \n \nYou start off flying a Jet-Pack over the ocean from a 3rd person perspective flying into the screen towards the island with the baddies coming towards you. You have a gun but can get icons to upgrade your gun. There are Hang-Gliders and a huge Helicopter to contend with as well before landing on the island and onto the next stage which the game then becomes a Beat -em-up. You view the action from the side as the game scrolls horizontally as you move from left to right. Baddies come at you from all sides and you kick or throw them. Baddies with guns will drop their weapons which you can collect and use before facing another boss who needs defeating to move on. \n \nOther game styles played has you running into the screen from a 3rd person perspective shooting the baddies coming towards you. As well as various weapons, you can collect smart-bombs to kill all on screen. The last style of gameplay is a beat-em-up again with weapons but you must jump up various levels to get to the top. As the game progresses it mixes up each level with these game styles.",

    "summary": "Democracy is a government simulation game that was first developed by Positech Games in 2005, with a sequel released in December 2007 and a third game in 2013. The player plays as if they are the president or prime minister of a democratic government. The player must introduce and alter policies in seven areas - tax, economy, welfare, foreign policy, transport, law and order and public services. Each policy has an effect on the happiness of various voter groups, as well as affecting factors such as crime and air quality. The player has to deal with \"situations\", which are typically problems such as petrol protests or homelessness, and also has to make decisions on dilemmas that arise each turn.",

You are simply a digital representation of who you once were when you were alive, transferred into an endless network of people‚Äôs memories called the Soul Cloud. Beginning your transfer into your new digital existence is simple: you sit on a monorail transporting you to your new home, a place where you can live out all your favorite memories for all time. But something is different‚Ä¶ a feeling of anxiety comes over you and something strange happens, causing you to black out. Waking up on a deserted beach without any knowledge of who you are or where you are, you bring yourself to your feet. Looking around you, everything you used to know has seemingly been wiped from your memory. Why did this happen? Did someone do this on purpose? If so, was it meant for you or someone else? \n\nIt\u0027s up to you to piece your memories together to find out all these answers by solving the puzzles in each memory from your past that are housed in there own rooms. However, this won‚Äôt be an easy task as not only are these puzzles very difficult, but you are also pursued by the Soul Cloud‚Äôs anti-virus who believes that you are the cause of all these \u0027problems\u0027 in the network. Every puzzle solved unlocks a memory which reveals more about your life when you were alive: a walk on a beach, visiting loved ones now lost from your life and confronting demons who have manipulated your career and very existence. \n\nOnce you have pieced together all your memories the games narrative and game play will lead you to a dramatic climax which brings the answers you are looking for but also questions the very nature of life and your creations coming back to haunt you.",

    "summary": "Shadows of Darkness is the fourth Quest for Glory game. It is a journey into the land of Mordavia - a setting influenced by Eastern Europe, particularly its Slavic areal. The hero had just begun to enjoy his victory in Tarna, when a spell zapped him into parts unknown, without a weapon, items, or even a source of light. Shortly after finding his way out of the dark cave, the hero meets a mysterious woman named Katrina. He traverses the swamps in the dark forest and finally reaches the town. However, the town is also engulfed by a foreboding atmosphere, and the hero cannot allow himself to relax. He must find out what is going on, why the town inhabitants are so hesitant and reluctant to help him, and what horrors are lurking outside of its walls. Life has never been quite so dangerous for our hero. He\u0027ll discover his quest soon enough - that is, if he lives.\n\nLike the previous Quest For Glory titles, the game is a combination of puzzle-solving adventure and role-playing. The player character can be a fighter, a thief, a magician, or a paladin. Importing a character from a preceding installment of the series is also possible. Once again the hero improves his skills by repeatedly using them (like throwing stones at a tree to improve the throwing ability, which might be needed to solve a puzzle). \n\nCombat system in this installment has undergone a major change. Battles are viewed from a side-scrolling perspective and are action-oriented. The protagonist is able to move freely, jump, and execute attacks and defensive moves, similarly to fighting games. The CD version of the game adds voice-overs to conversations as well as narrator\u0027s voice to text descriptions.",
