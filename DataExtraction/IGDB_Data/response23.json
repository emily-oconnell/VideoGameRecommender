During the 22nd century, the world\u0027s superpowers look towards space for expansion and began constructing large structures called orbital elevators. With an increasing number of surveillance satellites and space-based technologies being developed, a Cold War-style atmosphere sets in as the supranational unions used these technologies to watch over their adversaries on Earth. \n \nThe plot of Front Mission Evolved revolves around USN engineer Dylan Ramsey. As an engineer for the weapons developer Diable Avionics, Dylan begins testing of a prototype wanzer on Long Island, New York. In the midst of the wanzer test, unknown forces begin attacking New York City and its orbital elevator, Percival. Worried about his father\u0027s safety in the city, he sets off for New York City inside the prototype. As he travels through the city to reach the National Strategic Research Laboratory (NSRL), Ramsey assists USN forces battling the unknown assailants. After battling through numerous enemy wanzers, vehicles, and aircraft, Dylan makes it to the NSRL premises just as missiles are launched into the building. With his father seemingly dead, he engages the attacker, Marcus Seligman of the Apollo\u0027s Chariot. The fight is cut short when the orbital elevator begins crashing down on New York City.

    "summary": "Meteos Wars is a falling block puzzle game based on the Nintendo DS game Meteos. While the basic gameplay is identical in design, controlling with a gamepad instead of the touch-screen \u0026 Stylus pair makes it a different game. It consists of a board where coloured meteos plummet towards a planet\u0027s atmosphere. There, they form columns that the user can manipulate. The player moves a red cursor with two buttons to slide the meteos up or down. When three or more are lined up horizontally or vertically, they turn into ignited stone and are launched into space (the top of the screen) boosted by rockets. There they also catch all incoming meteos and often chain combos together. Ignitions based on vertical matches provide a more powerful ignition. As a group catches more incoming meteos, it becomes heavier and gravity pulls it down. The player can avoid that by causing secondary ignitions, either directly in the group or from below. If meteos can be lifted past the top of the screen, they fall down into the opponent\u0027s board. The game is over when a player\u0027s board is filled up entirely. \n \nAn additional button can be used to speed up time, creating time bombs to be sent into the opponent\u0027s board to cause an explosion. Meteos can also turn into ash and drop back down. When there is a full gauge at the bottom of the screen a planet impact can be caused. There are four types (Armageddon, Gambit, Sentinel and Tempest) each with different effects. Respectively, they lower the attack power, send more meteos while receiving less, fire a meteos missile, and fire lasers to clear away falling meteos as an additional means of defense. \n \nThe single-player has three game modes: a versus battle against the computer, mission mode, and attack mode. In the mission mode different planets need to be defeated before reaching Meteo. It is possible to unlock new planets and accessories along the way. Multiplayer against a human player is available both offline and online.",

    "storyline": "In the year 1935 E.C., the continent of Europa is dominated by two superpowers: The autocratic East Europan Imperial Alliance in the east and a commonwealth of loosely allied democracies known as the Atlantic Federation in the west. The economies of both powers depend on a precious multipurpose mineral called Ragnite. Its growing scarcity results in the Empire declaring war on the Federation, sparking the Second Europan War. The Empire uses its military superiority to quickly put the Federation on the defensive. Emboldened by their progress and momentum, the Empire decides to invade the neutral Principality of Gallia in order to seize its rich Ragnite deposits.\n\nWhen Imperial forces launch an attack on the Gallian border town of Bruhl, Welkin Gunther, son of late Gallian national hero General Belgen Gunther, is forced to fight for his life alongside the town watch captain, Alicia Melchiott. Together with Welkin\u0027s adopted sister Isara and using Belgen\u0027s prototype tank from the first war, the Edelweiss, they escape to Gallia\u0027s capital, Randgriz, and subsequently join the country\u0027s militia forces. Welkin is given the rank of lieutenant and assumes command of the newly-formed Squad 7, with Alicia acting as his non-commissioned officer. Initially, members of the squad question Welkin\u0027s qualifications due to a lack of combat experience; however, he quickly earns their trust and loyalty with his tactical genius. Welkin and Alicia soon become romantically engaged.",
    "summary": "Valkyria Chronicles is a tactical role-playing game developed and published by Sega for the PlayStation 3 in 2008. A Microsoft Windows version was released on November 11, 2014. A remastered version for PlayStation 4 was released in Japan on February 10, 2016 with a Western release planned for May 2016. Both PC and PS4 versions include previously released DLC.\n\nThe game is set in fictional Europa, loosely based on Europe during the early years of World War II. Because of its abundance of Ragnite ore, which takes the place of petroleum in the game setting, the neutral nation of Gallia comes under attack from the East Europan Imperial Alliance, which is itself engaged in war with the Atlantic Federation. Players take control of a unit of the Gallian Militia, dedicated to repelling the invasion. The game\u0027s visuals, which use Sega\u0027s CANVAS graphics engine, resemble pencil drawn paintings in motion.",

    "storyline": "The time of mortals is ending, and the reign of Chaos draws ever closer. The Dark Gods are at last united in a singular purpose, losing their madness across the world as never before. In the Empire of Sigmar, Karl Franz\u0027s gaze is focused on the incursion of the savage northmen, but it is not the only threat. As the Chaos moon Morrslieb waxes full, shrill voices echo through tunnels gnawed far beneath the Empire\u0027s cities, and a Skaven host swarms towards the surface. It emerges first in the city of Ubersreik, a screeching mass that consumes all before it. Soon Ubersreik is a charnel-town, drowning beneath the malevolent shadow of the Horned Rat. \n \nYet even in the darkest times, there are always champions to light the way. As Ubersreik cowers, five heroes, united by capricious fate, carry the fight to the rat-men. It remains to be seen whether they have the strength to survive, let alone work together long enough to thwart the invaders. One truth, however, is beyond all doubt: should these five fall, then Ubersreik will fall with them.",
    "summary": "Vermintide is a co-operative action first person shooter and melee combat adventure set in the End Times of the iconic Warhammer Fantasy universe. \n \nVermintide takes place in and around Ubersreik, a city overrun by Skaven. You will assume the role of one of five heroes, each featuring different play-styles, abilities, gear and personality. Working cooperatively, you must use their individual attributes to survive an apocalyptic invasion from the hordes of relentless rat-men, known as the Skaven. Battles will take place across a range of environments stretching from the top of the Magnus Tower to the bowels of the Under Empire.",

Tricks are smoother and may come a little more easily, but players will still have to hold the right line and perfect their timing if they\u0027re going to be real contenders in the Motocross circuit. Players will race through several indoor and outdoor tracks in this dirt bike simulation from EA SPORTS, and a freestyle mode is available as well, offering a perfect track for maximum air and wild tricks. \n \nThe most notable change in Supercross is that EA opted to go with a more arcade-styled control scheme this time around. While this may come as a disappointment to gamers looking for the ultimate motocross sim, fact of the matter is, they tried the more realistic approach in the last game and it did not work well. Besides, with this game\u0027s new hold-the-accelerator-and-don\u0027t-let-go approach, gamers will get a better sense of the speed they would experience in they actually participated in a motocross event. \n \nThe game is known in usa as Supercross 2001",

The levels are an inventive mix of standard platform action and 3-D scrolling levels; the latter usually having the player driving a jeep and repelling the enemy attacks. The game is based on the archetypal Hollywood action blockbuster and features a filmic score to back up the on-screen action. The player\u0027s only weapon is a whip - another nod to the Indiana Jones character - which can be used to both attack enemies and as a \u0027rope\u0027, to enable the player to reach distant platforms.",

Someone told him that to get there, he must be kind to everyone and bring happiness to their hearts. He received a bookmark, which was his entrance ticket to the magic library. \n \nOne day while heading to school, he received a text from the ‘shepherd’ (hitsujikai) telling him that his fate was going to change. He had a vision of an accident at the tram station and helped prevent any injuries by calling away a nearby girl. That girl, Tsugumi, later came to the Library Club room, which he was a member of, to thank him and also to ask for his help to make Shiomi Academy more fun. It seemed that she had also received a text from the shepherd, who is rumoured to appear before people who try their best to grant their wishes. One by one, other students also join their group with the shepherd’s guidance.",

Not wanting to panic the Claw over what you thought to be a radar malfunction, you went looking for the ghostly fighters. The search delayed your return to the Claw just long enough for the fighters to destroy the hapless carrier.\n\nLanding on the TCS Austin, you learned that you were the only pilot to encounter these “stealth” fighters. Furthermore, your flight recorder disk mysteriously disappeared right after you landed. Brought before a general court martial, you were charged with treason, and your claims about stealth fighters were ignored.\nA lack of evidence led to the treason charges being reduced to mere negligence, but you incurred the wrath of certain flag officers, Admiral Tolwyn among them. Your career appeared to be over. But you’re still a pilot in the Terran Confederation Navy and in Wing Commander II, your goal is to defeat the Kilrathi enemy. Each mission you fly (and your success or failure in each mission) affects the Confederation’s chances for ultimate victory.",

    "summary": "Tales of Zestiria is a Japanese role-playing game. It is the fifteenth main entry in the Tales series. As with previous entries in the Tales series, the game uses a variation of the action-based Linear Motion Battle System, with additional elements including a navigable open world, and the ability for certain characters to fuse into a single entity in battle to deliver powerful attacks. The story follows Sorey, a young man blessed with powers by a mystical spirit race known as the Seraphim who act as a stabilizing force in the land, as he travels to free the land of Glenwood from the threat of the Hellion, creatures spawned by negative emotions.",

Even after hundreds of years of slavery, the Mudlanders are determined to overthrow their masters. Tarnum appoints the Gnoll, Brellick, as a captain and the Witch, Adamina, as his advisor. He also trains Droglo, a human boy who was raised by Mudlanders. The Mudlanders defeat opposition from Lord Onsten and Baron Paglon before Mad King Gryphonheart of Erathia takes the rebellion seriously.\r\n\r\nMad King Gryphonheart sends his son Niven to put down the rebellion in Earl Rambert\u0027s territory, though he secretly thinks his son will fail. Tarnum captures Prince Niven and shows him what slavery has done to the Mudlanders. Niven eventually sides with Tarnum, and he is released from his prison. The Mudlanders force Rambert to retreat to another castle and leave many of his prisoners behind. When Rambert threatens to kill the remaining prisoners, including Adamina, if Tarnum does not return Niven, Tarnum sends Brellick, Droglo, and Niven to make the exchange after harming Niven so that he looks like a true prisoner. However, Rambert ambushes their army and kills Brellick. Droglo then kills Rambert, and the Mudlanders soon win the battle. To prepare for the final battles against Mad King Gryphonheart, Tarnum sends Droglo to request the aid of the Barbarians of Krewlod (the Wastelands).\r\n\r\nAdamina and the other wisewomen name the new Mudlander nation \"Tatalia,\" a word which means \"community\" in the forgotten Mudlander language now only known to witches. In Erathia, the nobles displeased with Mad King Gryphonheart name Niven as their new king. King Niven mounts an army to join the army of Tatalia in the fight against the old king\u0027s remaining supporters. Droglo finally discovers Tarnum\u0027s identity as the Immortal Hero, but accepts that he has changed. Tarnum and Mad King Gryphonheart meet in battle and deal each other seemingly mortal blows. However, Tarnum is immortal, and he slips away before his body can be buried. Droglo becomes the new leader of Tatalia.",
    "summary": "Heroes Chronicles: Revolt of the Beastmasters is the seventh game in the Heroes Chronicles series. As all the Heroes Chronicles games, Revolt is based on the Heroes of Might and Magic III engine, and consists of a campaign and a tutorial. Unlike Heroes III, in Revolt importing extra scenarios or playing in multiplayer is impossible.\r\nTarnum travels to the Mudlands of Tatalia, becoming a Beastmaster to free the Mudlanders from the oppression he brought upon them centuries ago. This campaign was one of two included in the single-disc installment, Heroes Chronicles: The Final Chapters.",

    "summary": "RPM Racing was preceded by Rareware\u0027s R.C. Pro-Am in 1988 and Electronic Art\u0027s Racing Destruction Set in 1985, with the latter being the larger influence. It is a precursor to Rock \u0027n Roll Racing, which was done by the same developer. Combat, obstacles and traction on the non-flat tracks play a significant role. There are 3 vehicle types to choose from that perform differently on pavement, dirt, ice, flat or bumpy tracks. Cars can be armed with oil, nitro and mines. Additionally, there are 3 levels of tires, engines, shocks and armor. There are full race season, single race and custom track modes. In 1 player games, the 2nd player is replaced with one of 8 AI opponents who are each associated with their own vehicle. In season mode, each track has an entrance fee and cash prize for placing 1st; often lesser cash prizes for lesser placements are also awarded. For an additional fee, racers can opt to move to a higher racing class (levels) where fees and prizes are bigger. Each class has its own set of tracks that the player may choose from. No track is mandatory or unavailable within a class. The player also has the option of going back to a lower class for free, which may become necessary if funds are eaten up be fees without winning prizes. However, going up always incurs a fee, even if the player has been there before. Custom track designing is not intuitive but fairly easy to learn. Players can set the track\u0027s laps, gravity and starting line type. Each track section can be pavement, dirt, or ice. Track sections are laid out like puzzle pieces on a 2D non-isometric grid (Pipe-Mania style). Sections include horizontal and vertical straights, four standard 90° turns, eight T-sections for diverging and converging multiple paths in any direction and a criss-cross. Either a horizontal or vertical special straight section is used as the starting grid. The starting grid can be oriented forward, reversed, face-off with player 1 forward, or face-off with player 1 reversed. 7 points are used to adjust the 6 slopes in straight sections to 5 different heights. Slopes can be flat (0:1), inclined (1:1), or steep (2:1). Non-straight sections can only be adjusted for height for the entire section at once. An isometric view of individual sections is provided to help to orient the section\u0027s design to the adjacent sections. If the edge of a section does not match the height of the adjacent section(s), the player is warned immediately but may proceed without correcting the error immediately. But such error must be eliminated before the track can be saved. Also required for a track to be saved is no dead ends, and a starting grid section. The track verification is surprisingly liberal, even allowing diverging and converging paths that are against the flow of traffic (like turning around and going the wrong way up a freeway merging lane). The AI opponents are generally not able to discern the fastest or shortest route and can even be diverted into a path with no natural exit, or with very clever path designs, valid lap paths can be entirely different for player 1, player 2 and AI players; which can lead to interesting traffic patterns.",

    "summary": "A NES game based on the famed Paris-Dakar Rally, developed by ISCO. While ostensibly a racing game, the style of gameplay tends to change per level.\n\nParis-Dakar Rally Special! is an unusual racing game in which the player must successfully win the Paris-Dakar Rally. However, in order to do so, the player is faced with a wide variety of odd challenges to overcome, a scant number of which actually involve racing.\n\nDeveloped by ISCO for the NES, Paris-Dakar Rally is notorious for its bizarre structure. Depending on who is asked it is either a testament to the NES library\u0027s occasionally creative and off-beat ingenuity, or a legendary \"kusoge\" (crap game).\n\nStage 1 - Preparation\nIn the first stage the player is without vehicle. In order to race in the Paris-Dakar Rally, the player must first acquire a sponsor, some money, a car and a navigation partner. In order to achieve these objectives, the player must walk around town and talk to the right order of sponsors, executives, bank tellers and rally co-ordinators to begin. Once the car has been purchased and a navigation partner chosen (which is resolved with a fast reactions mini-game), the player can take a plane to Paris to begin the rally.\n\nStage 2 - First Day\nThe first day races most closely resemble an actual racing game. The player has a top-down view of a vertically-scrolling track and must control the car\u0027s speed and direction with the D-pad. In order to qualify for the next stage of the event, the player must make it through the course within a time limit while dodging hostile vehicles from behind and in front. Losing three lives restarts the stage.\n\nStage 3 - Second Day\nThis mode more closely resembles the Arcade game Rally-X. The player must maneuver and corner around the Parisian streets in order to avoid rival drivers. They can distract pursuing CPU opponents by dropping rubber balls (possibly tires) behind the player\u0027s car to deter them.\n\nStage 4 - Third Day\nThe action changes to a side-scrolling perspective and now the player must contend with birds dropping deadly eggs, bridges that collapse once driven on, rolling boulders, fires and other obstacles on the racecourse. Occasionally, the player will need to leave the vehicle in order to hit a switch to extend a bridge before they can continue.\n\nStage 5 - Fourth Day\nAs the player is on a variant of the Paris-Dakar course that will inconveniently cross a major sea, the player must steer their car-boat over and under the ocean and avoid various hostile sea creatures and jagged rocks.\n\nStage 6 - Fifth Day\nInto the Dakar desert, the player must drive vertically up the screen while avoiding vicious desert animals like snakes, scorpions, spiders, camels and other hostile racers. The player must also contend with some narrow walls and a section where they must cross between two rafts.\n\nStage 7 - Sixth Day\nAt some point between starting the race and the sixth day, World War 3 broke out and the player must use their newly mounted machine guns to take down the enemy aircraft and tanks between them and the finishing line.\n\nStage 8 - Final Day\nThe Dakar finish line is just ahead, all the player must do is survive a gauntlet similar to that of the First Day. As with that stage, the player must be alert for other racers all around them and make it to the end within the time limit.",

    "summary": "The little town of Spielburg is populated mostly by beer-drinking humans and some centaurs who like working in the field. Spielburg is surrounded by forests and mountains, where all kinds of weird creatures dwell: ogres, goblins, talking foxes, stupid magicians, and others. Lately, Spielburg has been assaulted by brigands; besides, the witch Baba Yaga is not to be trusted. The town has everything it needs--even a Thieves Guild--except a strong, brave hero who would protect it. So when a wandering adventurer enters the town, he quickly realizes that his skills might be of use.\n\nHero\u0027s Quest: So You Want to Be a Hero is a hybrid game that contains Role-Playing and Adventure elements. It is visually very similar to other Quest titles by Sierra (such as for example Space Quest), but the gameplay--besides the usual exploration, conversations with characters, and the solving an occasional puzzle with the help of inventory items--also involves combat and character development. In the beginning of the game, the player chooses a character class for the protagonist--either a Fighter, a Mage, or a Thief. The choice of class will influence not only the combat, but also many other events in the game. Puzzles might have different solutions depending on the class and the amount of ability points in various categories.\n\nThe main character\u0027s skills and abilities are raised directly by repeatedly performing appropriate actions, e.g. fighting enemies, practicing, climbing, throwing objects, etc. Many of those activities are necessary to perform in order to successfully complete the game. Combat takes the player to a separate screen (represented by the enemy\u0027s picture) and involves timed selection of commands such as Attack, Parry, etc. The interaction with the game-world is performed by typing verb commands or conversation topics.\n\nThe game features a day/night cycle, which also includes character schedules. The main character can get hungry and tired, so feeding him and getting some rest is essential.",

Each snake can have own color, programmed AI, and it is password-protected. Training is concluded in pre-defining the nine schemes of possible snake behaviours on the battlefield. The player does not control the snake directly. Each match requires up to four snakes on the battlefield, and the goal of each snake is to eat the tail of another snake. With each eaten tail the snake is increased, and the snake without tail is reduced. The winner of the match is a snake with a greater length. \n \nThe game was released only in Russia.",

The game is a spin-off of The Idolmaster series and its timeline coincides before the events in The Idolmaster 2. The gameplay in Dearly Stars is similar to previous games in the series, but with new elements and differences to the minigames. The gameplay was adjusted to allow the player the option to quickly play through the game\u0027s story, but head director also wanted to add in gameplay elements that would add another layer of challenge. The story is told from the perspective of three prospective pop idols introduced in Dearly Stars as they enter the talent agency 876 Production, and deals with their training on their way to stardom. The player has access to the three idols\u0027 different scenarios when playing, and each one involves a branching plot line.",
