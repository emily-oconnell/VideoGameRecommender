Once enough enemies have been killed, an exit will open which the player must enter. The floating ball gradually diminishes and the player will have to drop to the bottom of the screen several times to get a replacement ball. \n \nThe final screen takes place on the scientist\u0027s production line; with machinery that must be carefully negotiated. Two large robots bar the route to the scientist and must be destroyed before the scientist can be reached.",

Gameplay is composed of several different types of missions, each broken up into short mini-games.\nThe first part of the game requires the player to activate oxygen and hydrogen pumps as well as get additional crew members into the shuttle within a strict time limit by moving an elevator up and down and avoiding moving bumpers. Then, the player must successfully launch the shuttle into space by performing quick time events that correspond to particular shuttle launch maneuvers such as booster rocket separation. Once in space, one of several missions will be played where the player must control the astronaut by maneuvering him around hazards, replenish his air supply before the timer runs out, and deliver components for the International Space Station to their correct locations. A cosmonaut from the Soviet Union must also be rescued in the game.\nFinally, the player must land the shuttle by again performing Quick Time Events that correspond to landing maneuvers before finally landing at Edwards Air Force Base.",

Some enemies can kill you pretty easily in 1x1 hallways. \n* Explore the room carefully for easy enemies that drop edible items and items scattered around. \n* Falling down a hole will damage you and also let the enemies take a turn. On harder floors this can do a lot of damage. \n* Move slowly.",

    "summary": "Gaia Seed is a horizontally scrolling shooter from Techno Soleil. The game comes from the fabulous line of classically-styled Japanese shoot \u0027em ups, bursting at the seams with parallax scrolling, screen-filling bosses and other classic effects that you could count on from the games of this era. But the real beauty of GaiaSeed lies in its subtlety. The game has tight control, precise bullet collision, and a simple powerup system, while the haunting soundtrack stands out for its techno/ambiance mood, adding to the subliminal nature of the work. \n \nYou have a single ship choice and three difficulties. Gaming veterans will want to start on HARD, which differs only slightly if at all from NORMAL, and isn\u0027t particularly challenging anyway. You get two extra credits in NORMAL, for a total of 5, which is ample if you want to credit feed your way to the best ending. No one should touch EASY, since it limits you to reaching Stage 4. There are 7 stages with 3 possible endings, none of which are affected by credit usage. \n \nPower-ups consist of 2 main shots (RED and BLUE), 2 sub-weapons (YELLOW and GREEN), and an eIntense Shot\u0027 based on your main weapon which basically acts like a Power Bomb. Main weapons stack up to 3 times (RED: starts on 1 shot then 2, 3 and finally 4 shots), sub-weapons don\u0027t stack. Lose a ship and you lose your sub-weapon, while your main weapon goes down one level. \n \nBLUE is the Laser Shot, a straight line weapon with strong frontal attack which increases in thickness and power as you stack it. The laser\u0027s eintense shot\u0027 is a massive sausage of light cutting across the screen and wiping out all in its path. RED is Needle Shot. This is your typical V-shot weapon. Less powerful than BLUE, but when stacked 3 times has a wide ranging spread. The intense shot is a series of blue homing orbs target enemies and weak points on bosses, making this the best main weapon. GREEN is the Cipher Wave, the best sub-weapon since it fires four blobs which home in on enemies and can attack craft which are behind you, which is essential during boss fights. YELLOW is the Energy Blaster and acts like an additional V-shot weapon. Absolute rubbish. \n \nWith such a simple weapons set most players will opt for a RED and GREEN combo for the game\u0027s duration. Which isn\u0027t a criticism. Gaia Seed doesn\u0027t distract you with superfluity; it\u0027s functional, with a focus on dodging and shooting. What\u0027s especially cool, and sets it apart from other shmups, is that both your health bar and Intense Shot bar are continuously recharging. This effectively gives you infinitely spawning power bombs and infinite health - but it doesn\u0027t break the game\u0027s balancing. \n \nEnemies frequently use screen-filling beam-based draining weapons, forcing you to let off a volley of shots and then scramble out of the beam\u0027s attack before your life is fully drained. With bosses this creates some intense battles of endurance - especially if you\u0027re trying to beat them by letting the timer run down (those are some pretty intense 120 seconds). After escaping a draining blast you can lick your wounds at the screen\u0027s edge, healing while avoiding bullet patterns. The patterns are fairly busy but without ever reaching danmaku levels of weaving. A slight comparison could be made to Deep Blue on the PC Engine, which had a recharging health bar and encouraged enemy avoidance (as pointed out by Mag Weasel). \n \nA mention must go to Gaia Seed\u0027s timed bosses. Defeating them by letting the timer reach zero doesn\u0027t do much during the main game apart from giving you a sense of accomplishment, but if you want to see the best ending you\u0027ll let the two final Stage 7 bosses\u0027 live. \n \nVisually almost everything is sprite based, though it varies in terms of quality. The first stage contains hundreds of massive though pixelated objects moving around, while the second has some interesting Mode 7 styled screen rotation effects. Stage 3 contains some decent parallax scrolling, though not as good as in Thunder Force IV. Subsequent levels are reasonable but without flair. \n \nThe stand out element of Gaia Seed though has to be its soundtrack, which almost warrants download alone. It\u0027s extremely unconventional, being a blend of ambient music with chanting, classical music, hip-hop and thumping techno. Stage 2\u0027s track almost sounds as if it\u0027s been taken from Panzer Dragoon Saga. It\u0027s eclectic, strange, and very good. The sole composer was Xacs Ishikawa, also known as Naoto Ishikawa, a fairly obscure composer connected to works like Psyvariar and Touhou. Interestingly, he also collaborated with Harumi Shiina to remix Koji Endo\u0027s King\u0027s Field soundtrack, to create an album called Invitation to the Graveyard ~ King\u0027s Field I Arrange Collection.",

One day, he meets a strange girl, Kirari Shiino, at work and before he knows it, they\u0027ve formed a punk band. \n \nThe band consists of Shikanosuke, Kirari, his childhood friend Chie Isurugi, and a rich but weak young lady by the name of Sarina Kashiwara. The four of them are members of the Second Literature Club, which has hardly any active members and is already scheduled to be disbanded. This band is their chance to stand out and give one final farewell at the Culture Festival. \n \nThe challenge was foolhardy, but after eccentric training they managed to succeed and rock out the peaceful Oubi Academy with their debut performance. That should have been it. \nThey were satisfied. \nThey should have returned to their normal lives. \nHowever, their final performance at a local Live House became a hit on the Internet and requests for their performance start flying in from far and wide. \n \nOne problem: exams are coming up and their parents are opposed to the band! \n \nWho cares! \n \nThe four of them embark on their final adventure, a long tour of Japan, armed with their dreams and their instruments, all aboard a rickety van that could fall apart at any moment.",

Money is earned after each level for the purpose of upgrading the player\u0027s vehicle. Players can improve their engines, purchase extra lives, shovels that can dig better, and weapons to improve the odds on the playing field. A kill ratio is required to be met in order to reach the next stage. Otherwise, the player remains in the current level. \n \nAfter finishing all 48 levels, the game proclaims that the \"battle is over\" and that the player becomes \"the new champion.\" The final scene in the game is where the player looks over the sunset with his girlfriend along with the closing credits.",

    "summary": "As a haulier focused on heavy transports there is no transport problem you can’t deal with. Whether \"normal\" heavy cargo or loads of more than 400 tonnes (800 000 pounds), you transport each single freight safely to its destination. Powerful tractor units in different classes of load capacities and the required, matching semi-trailers are loaded in delivery order. Even in the event of special transports with unusual and challenging dimensions you keep cool and calm and know exactly how to remove obstacles, such as signs and stones efficiently from the road.\n\nGood planning is the basis for a smooth work flow. Therefore careful preparation of the routes, precise time management and the gauging of loading and unloading facilities are among the routine tasks of your team. But only if you are aware of all the possible challenges will you be able to work uninterrupted!",

Loki steals Odin\u0027s sword, Freyr\u0027s spear and Thor\u0027s hammer, rendering them powerless. They decide to create an infant, the title character (named after the god of the same name), who must bring back the three legendary weapons. \n \nThe game sees Heimdall and his crew travelling around an archipelago of islands in three different maps: Utgard, Midgard and Asgard. They travel engaging monsters in combat, interacting with the locals, solving puzzles and avoiding traps, a blend of styles somewhat similar to that found in the Legend of Zelda games. The cartoon-style action is viewed in the isometric perspective.",

    "summary": "QuickSpot (爽解！右脳の達人 まちがいミュージアム Unou no Tatsujin: Soukai! Machigai Museum?) is a video game for the Nintendo DS developed by Namco Bandai. It is designed similar to games such as Brain Age which uses simple brain teaser to exercise reflexes and brain function. It is a part of Nintendo\u0027s Touch! Generations brand. \n \nThe game: \nThe game projects two images, the correct one on the top screen, and an error filled one on the bottom screen. Comparing the two images, the player has to locate and find the inaccuracies or changes from the top screen to the touch screen. \n \nConcept: \nThis game is based on the traditional game spot the difference. GamePro.com described the game \"like a mix between Where\u0027s Waldo and the Hidden Pictures section in Highlights magazine\". \n \nControls: \nThe players use none of the face buttons or D-Pad on the DS. The entire game is played using the touch screen and stylus. The player draws a circle using the stylus when the player spots the difference between the top image on the bottom screen. In some instances, the built in microphone is used. \n \nModes and gameplay: \nRapid Play: In this game there is one difference in the two images, which the player is tested to find and circle as fast as you can. This keeps on repeating at a quick pace until the timer runs out. \nFocused Mode: Only working with one set of pictures, the player finds a number of things different in each picture. Once the player find them all or when time runs out, the player complete the stage. \nToday Fortune: A daily routine practiced in the game. The player selects a category, health, work, romance, or money, only one each per day. Then they play a trimmed down version of the Rapid Play mode. . At the end, the game calculates the player\u0027s fortune depending on the specific choices he or she made for each picture. \n \nMultiplayer: \nQuickSpot uses DS Download Play with support for up to eight players. Two exclusive modes appear in this mode that are not playable in the single player game. \n \nTime Bomb: \nA hot potato type mode for up to eight players. The players simply pass the DS around to the next player once the previous player solves the current puzzle. The player left holding the DS when the bomb explodes loses. \nScramble Mode A Multi-DS Cart mode that has up to three players competing at the same puzzles. The player who circles the fastest is the winner, however those on the losing end can eventually build up a meter that gives them access to unique power-ups. This varies from turning an opponent\u0027s screen into a negative view or obscure an opponent\u0027s screen by sending a swarm of frogs across the screen.",

    "summary": "Wolf Team is a high-octane MMOFPS that features the ability to transform between Humans and Werewolves. Humans have a vast assortment of weapons at their disposal, giving them an advantage at a distance. Wolves have limited ranged attacks but are much faster, stronger, and more durable than their human counterparts. \n \n \n \nThe ability to switch between Human and Wolf form at any time adds an element of strategy that is wholly unique to Wolf Team. Players never need worry about running out of ammunition because Wolves have their own distinct advantages – such as running on walls then dropping onto enemies unexpectedly. In certain modes, players can even harness special Wolf mutations, such as Ghost Wolves, which can turn invisible. \n \n \n \nVariety is the spice of life; Wolf Team has several addictive game modes to choose from. Just want to engage in an all-out no-holds-barred melee? Fire up a traditional Deathmatch. Interested in joining forces with other players to wage a more cerebral, tactical battle? Try Conquest mode, in which players to work as a team to capture as many bases as possible, or Destruction mode, in which one team tries to demolish the other team\u0027s base. Wolf Team also features a large selection of weapons players can acquire as they progress through the game.",

Requiring perfection, only perfect puzzle pieces are selected for use and those who are imperfect are shunned by society and decommissioned. Thrown into this hostile environment, it is up to a couple of misfits to find their place in this unbending society.\n\nRefactor is a physics-based platformer taking elements from classic Metroidvanias. Placed in a world that is a puzzle itself, you can literally turn the world upside down by rearranging the map and building your own pathways through the game. Uncover secrets, acquire new abilities and upgrades, and discover where you fit in the world.",
