With help from a \"stranger\" you are soon set on the path to their salvation from the despicable Lord of the Swampyards, Stratolustrious Von Danderbeak the 37th (or Strato for short, his name is a mouth-full). If you succeed in rescuing your friends and bringing down the Swampyard Tyrant, then glory, satisfaction, and maybe a nap await you.",

These chronicle the decline of China\u0027s Ming Dynasty and its conquest by the Manchu Qing Dynasty. It also includes the Mandate of Heaven sandbox campaign that enables players to freely choose the opposing forces fighting for supremacy over the Chinese mainland and Mongolian steppes. \n \nMandate of Heaven also introduces new factions and their unique units. These include the Tibetan lords and their rivals who possess heavy lancer cavalry who also use bows. Also included is Ming loyalist Koxinga\u0027s army and his famous Tie Ren (Iron Men). Finally, the later Western Mongol army is updated to include dismounted troops as employed by the Dzungar Khanate. \n \nFight for the right to rule China with the Mandate of Heaven!",

Amidst the depression and its riots of jobless workers, a mad scientist starts his plan of world domination. Taking command in the titular fortress orbiting Earth, the evil Doctor Gegeben Funkerun uses his own robots, flying fortresses and mercenaries to wreak havoc across the globe until all his demands are met. Assisting the attacked and weakened governments, workers across the nations help develop a series of jet fighters called the Aizerun Geist to use against the forces of Dr. Funkerun and save the world. \n \nBefore each stage begins, players are given a choice of weapons to purchase at a hangar for the Aizerun Geist. There are four weapons within three tiers to choose from including Main Attack, Sub Weapon and Bomb. Of the Main Attack the player can choose Twin Shot, Laser, Heavy Laser and the Charge Shot. Of the Sub Weapons, players can choose additional firepower, Homing Missiles, Shielded Options or an energy barrier. Players can stock up on multiple bombs including Small bombs, rockets, larger bombs or napalm. \n \nThe Aizerun Geist provides tactical advantages during combat with the use of its manually directional Sub Weapon. Players are able to direct additional firepower in five directions including vertical and horizontal by pressing the bomb button while firing. The game runs for six stages through various settings such as a jungle, stormy skies, Tokyo and Fortress Strahl itself.",

I’ll be helping you get those romantic connections going, so you better be grateful!\n\nThen again, my bonus is tied to the ratings, and not you surviving the show, so… Hm.\n\nAnyway….\n\nI can’t wait to start filming our first episode together!",

Eventually, he will return home and claim his rightful place as the Lion King. On his journey, Simba must avoid such dangers of the jungles and plains as wildebeests and rhinos. When he encounters these enemies as a cub, his roar does little to scare them off. However, maturing into a majestic lion deepens his voice and makes the growl useful as a weapon. As he explores the nine levels, Simba will be able to collect a wide variety of items that will open several bonuses that include puzzles, mini-games, and movies. While the film was animated in 2D, Simba and his world are rendered in three dimensions, and the plot unfolds in cinematic sequences between each level. You\u0027ve got to help Simba take his rightful place in DISNEY\u0027S THE LION KING: Simba\u0027s Mighty Adventure.",

    "summary": "O\u0027Leary Manager 2000 is a football player-manager game released in 2000 for the Game Boy Color. The player can choose whether they want to focus on the management side of football, play the matches themselves on the game\u0027s 2D match engine, or combine the two features for a more in-depth experience. It is endorsed by Irish football manager David O\u0027Leary, who was managing Leeds United A.F.C. at the time of the game\u0027s release.\n\nThe management side of O\u0027Leary Manager 2000 is very comprehensive when compared to similar Game Boy Color games. The player can choose from 240 fully licensed teams from the top two leagues in England, France, Italy, Spain, Germany and the Netherlands to play as or manage, with each team having 16 players in their squad. There is also the option to promote a number of fictional youth team players. However, most of the youth team players are of low ability, so could only realistically be used for back-up when managing a decent quality team.\n\nAs with any football management game, the transfer market can often play a key role in whether the team achieves success. The player\u0027s selected team starts with either 10.5m or 5.5m to spend, depending on whether they were in the first or second tier of their country\u0027s football hierarchy. The player can also recoup some money by selling players to other teams. This is done by first offering the footballer for sale at a chosen price, from which interested clubs would then place offers that the player could choose to accept or not. Once a price is agreed, the footballer transfers clubs instantly. The values of footballers alternate greatly during the game, with the then Real Betis striker Denílson being the most expensive player at the start of the game. An unfortunate bug in the game allows the player to gain a huge sum of money (around 70m) if the club goes into a certain amount of debt, which pretty much negates the need for financial planning.\n\nThe club\u0027s board of directors constantly give assessments as to how they think the club is progressing under your management. This involves a short statement visible at the menu screen. Other features available the menu screen include options to change you team line-up, formation and tactics; all vital when creating a successful team.\n\nSimilarly, you can decide what methods of training your team will undertake for the coming week. You have the option to \"do training\", which generally increase the statistics of your players (but at the risk of injuring them) or to concentrate on fitness training (which helps players stay fit and injured players to recover quicker). Alternatively, you may choose to skip training entirely for the week. You also have the option to view various statistics, such as league tables from around the world, top goalscorers and to view the squads of all available teams on the game.",

    "summary": "Uchuu Senkan Gomora (宇宙戦艦ゴモラ), is a shoot-em-up by UPL, originally released in 1990 for the arcade, and then ported to the Sega Mega Drive in 1991. While the arcade version was released overseas (in the US under license from American Sammy under the name Bio-Ship Paladin), the MD version was only released in Japan — however an American title screen is present in the ROM and displayable if the region is set to US, which may mean a US release was planned (this is unconfirmed). It is UPL\u0027s only Mega Drive game — they would go bankrupt shortly after publishing it (the later Task Force Harrier EX was ported and published by Treco). \n \nA shoots your weapons; the laser weapon from your main ship can be charged by holding A. B allows you to take control of a beam shot. While B is held down, the D-pad will move a box-shaped target on the screen and A will shoot beam shots toward the target. C is listed as \"PAD MODE\" but does not appear to do anything. In each level, you can get orbs which give you either subships that shoot weapons diagonally or certain powerups (such as an automatically moving beam target or doubling the size of your ship). \n \nPressing Start at the title screen gives you a configuration menu where you can, among other things, choose to play one of two 2-player modes. Normal 2-player mode is 2-player cooperative (two ships on screen at once), while another option allows the second player to take control of the beam laser while you take control of the main ship.",

    "summary": "\"NAUGHTY BOY\" is an action game released by JALECO in 1982. Travel across forests, through barbed wire fences, and over rivers to purge the castle of monsters with fire! The stone-throwing action takes some getting used it, but once you experience the satisfaction of striking an enemy, you\u0027ll be hooked on it. The \"Arcade Archives\" series has faithfully reproduced many classic Arcade masterpieces. Players can change various game settings such as game difficulty, and also reproduce the atmosphere of arcade display settings at that time. Players can also compete against each other from all over the world with their high scores. Please enjoy the masterpiece that built a generation for video games.",

In fact, this version, now dubbed \u0027Long Road Ahead\u0027, is pretty much exactly the one we graduated with.\n\nWe are uploading it here in order to clear our heads, re-process our development and design processes that led us to this version, and to gather feedback. We hope that all of this will help us with development of the new version of Northbound, so please let us know if you liked it.\n\nIf you are interested, please follow us on Twitter for updates on the current state of development.",

Each level\u0027s goal is to find an artefact which will lead the way to the next world. Most enemies can be killed by jumping onto them. It is important to hit them from above. Touching an enemy\u0027s side or contact from below are lethal for the hero. After collecting 50 gems of any kind you will be granted an extra life. Each level is concluded by a statistics screen. It will display the number of collected items and killed enemies, opposed to total numbers. Upon reaching the maximum possible numbers, an extra bonus is granted.",

A tremor topples the coffin and Ico escapes. As he searches the castle, he comes across Yorda (ヨルダ, Yoruda), a captive girl who speaks a different language. Ico helps Yorda escape and defends her from shadow-like creatures. The pair makes their way through the castle and arrive at the bridge leading to land. As they cross, the Queen, ruler of the castle, appears and tells Yorda that as her daughter she cannot leave the castle. Later, as they try to escape on the bridge, it splits up and they get separated. Yorda tries to save Ico but the Queen prevents it. He ends up falling off the bridge and losing consciousness. \n \nIco awakens below the castle and makes his way back to the upper levels, finding a magic sword that dispels the shadow creatures. After discovering that Yorda has been turned to stone by the Queen, he confronts the Queen in her throne room, who reveals that she plans to restart her life anew by taking possession of Yorda\u0027s body. Ico slays the Queen with the magic sword, but his horns are broken in the fight and at the end of it he is knocked unconscious. With the Queen\u0027s death the castle begins to collapse around Ico, but the Queen\u0027s spell on Yorda is broken, and a shadowy Yorda carries Ico safely out of the castle to a boat, sending him to drift to the shore alone. Ico awakens to find the distant castle in ruins, and Yorda, in her human form, washed up nearby. She wakes up and smiles at Ico. \n \nShadow of the Colossus: \nThe story of Shadow of the Colossus begins as Wander enters the forbidden land, traveling across a long bridge on his horse, Agro. Unknown to the player, prior to entering, Wander had stolen an ancient sword, which is the only weapon capable of slaying the colossi.[34] Led to the massive Shrine of Worship at the center of the region, Wander carries with him the body of a maiden named Mono. A moment later, several humanoid shadow creatures appear and approach Wander before he easily dismisses them with a wave of the ancient sword in his possession. After vanquishing the shadow creatures, the voice of the disembodied entity known as \"Dormin\" echoes from above, expressing surprise that Wander possesses the weapon. Wander requests that Dormin return Mono\u0027s soul to her body, which Dormin states may be possible on the condition that Wander can destroy the sixteen idols lining the temple\u0027s hall by using the ancient sword to kill each colossus the idols represent located throughout the land. Despite being warned by Dormin that he may have to pay a great price to revive Mono, Wander sets out to search the land for the colossi and destroy them.",
    "summary": "The Ico \u0026 Shadow of the Colossus Collection is a video game bundle that contains high-definition remasters of two older PlayStation 2 games for the PlayStation 3, and was developed by Bluepoint Games and released alongside Ico as The Ico \u0026 Shadow of the Colossus Collection in September 2011. \n \nThe Collection features: \n- High-definition (HD) graphics \n- Content previously missing from the North American release \n- PlayStation Network Trophies \n- 3D support.",

    "storyline": "The game is set in the year 2171, 50 years after the events of Front Mission 5: Scars of the War. During the 22nd century, the world\u0027s superpowers look towards space for expansion and began constructing large structures called orbital elevators. With an increasing number of surveillance satellites and space-based technologies being developed, a Cold War-style atmosphere sets in as the supranational unions used these technologies to watch over their adversaries on Earth. \n \nThe plot of Front Mission Evolved revolves around USN engineer Dylan Ramsey. As an engineer for the weapons developer Diable Avionics, Dylan begins testing of a prototype wanzer on Long Island, New York. In the midst of the wanzer test, unknown forces begin attacking New York City and its orbital elevator, Percival. Worried about his father\u0027s safety in the city, he sets off for New York City inside the prototype. As he travels through the city to reach the National Strategic Research Laboratory (NSRL), Ramsey assists USN forces battling the unknown assailants. After battling through numerous enemy wanzers, vehicles, and aircraft, Dylan makes it to the NSRL premises just as missiles are launched into the building. With his father seemingly dead, he engages the attacker, Marcus Seligman of the Apollo\u0027s Chariot. The fight is cut short when the orbital elevator begins crashing down on New York City. After Percival collapses, Dylan is recruited into the USN Army as it prepares for war against the Oceania Cooperative Union.",
    "summary": "Crush the competition with 2 wanzers from the Front Mission franchise - the Stork Mk. IV and Tatou. \n \nNOTE: There are numbering differences between the Japanese and English releases for the same content. Japanese stores released as \"Wanzer Pack 1\", while western stores released as \"Wanzer Pack 2\".",

Now the machinery has taken on a life of its own! Assume control of Charlie the Egg in your effort to find the reset switch located somewhere within the factory. The game consists of 43 pre-rendered levels and 12 boss characters, all of which are various forms of machinery, from Blast Furnace Bill to Rotato the Repair Robot. \n \nIn order to clear a level, Charlie must locate a certain number of time clocks and hit them with his wrench. To reach the clocks, he\u0027ll need to walk across narrow ledges, spinning gears, and past open flames. Besides using the wrench, Charlie can also jump, throw bolts and roll away. Items to look out for are paper airplanes (they\u0027ll give you information or clues), donuts to replenish any damage, coins to give you extra lives and fans to cool you down. After all, moving through a hot steel factory can be especially dangerous to an egg. The game automatically saves your progress to memory card, so keep moving and save that factory! \n \nThe most notable feature of the game is the number of impressive CG cinemas that play constantly throughout your adventure. If you fall off an edge, you\u0027ll see Charlie do a Humpty Dumpty impression, and if you make it to the next level by punching the last time clock, a transition scene will play.",

The entire game takes place in the broken mind of Lilly Witchgan, and the goal is to discover who is real – Lilly herself or one of her many personalities. The plot will tell us about her many minds and how are they fighting each other.\n\nDuring the game, the player controls two characters at the same time and one of them repeats the actions after another. If the player turns left – both of the girls will go left, if the player turns right – both of them go right, if one dies – the other is buried with her. The difficulty is in finding the exit of the map, which is separated into two different parts. Maybe one of the girls will see only flowers in front of her, but that doesn’t mean that there isn’t a trap before her second personality. You will find a variety of traps that bring diversity into the game mechanics.\n\nHere, madness is represented as it really is – Lilly is a foreigner in her own body and her memory is broken into pieces by the other personalities. She can’t remember many hours of her life, even days, months and years. Her live is a broken puzzle and we are here to help this girl.",

The game was re-released in 1998 through the Nintendo Power service, adding Super Game Boy support and featuring a bestiary for encountered monsters; this version was called God Medicine Hukkokuban. \n \nA video gaming company was to release Phantom, their new RPG, but the company mysteriously is destroyed. Noah, Ken, and Miki are three RPG fans that are disappointed by this. Wandering about, they stumble upon a shack with a great demon inside, battling three warriors. The warriors are defeated and the demon exits through a portal. The warriors give their souls and powers to the three RPG fans, who now must enter Phantom to save the game\u0027s world. However, they must also protect the real world from the demon. \n \nGod Medicine features standard RPG elements. The three characters can level up through battle and equip weapons and armor. Spells can be learned, as well as Maphu attacks. After the party collects Maphu gems and gains the special Maphu weapons, they can put the gems in the weapons. Each gem has a different effect depending on what character equips it. Some Maphu attacks need to be charged during battle first. The charges last even if the battle is finished. The player can save anytime, except in battle.",

Several countries started to arranged annual activities using the revolutionary \nHi-Finesse System. However, the biggest and most anticipated competition of them all is about to take place in Vancouver, Canada. The students at Canadian Academy for Interactive Arts Development (CAIAD), will be battling against each other in a gigantic glorious virtual war utilizing all their own in-game creations. You play as Lisbeth Dille, \na player for the upcoming Virtual-Reality Game Championship (VRGC). But meanwhile, the city is struggling with a political issue that might affect her life.\n\nNOTE: \nThis is only a 15-20 minutes long prologue. \nIt does not feature the championship.\nMy game is not great, my game might not be good at all, but i sure have learned from feedback how to improve my skills in this field. I hope that you will give this game a chance, and perhaps give me feedback wich makes me better in making games in the future. Since this game is my first game, thus not the best, and since it has a very untraditional design that many will propably hate, we chose to not charge for this game. It will be free to download and play.\n\nFEATURES\n- Visual Novel conversations with western cel-shaded visuals \n- A softcore sci-fi with a realistic and achievable depiction of near-future VR \n- Experimental untraditional game \n- Challenging shooting segments \n- Hybrid orchestral soundtrack\n\nTHF2D was among other reasons, born out of the wish for 2D indie-games that offered other visuals than the retro style. The game was developed using modern HQ cel-shading 2D visuals.\n\nThe score was composed utilizing Hollywood softwares such as Vienna Strings and cutting-edge sound design packages to provide a colourful soundtrack ranging from AAA-orchestral music, electronical and some lower quality tunes. Whether we have succeeded in making a worthy product or not........is entirely up to the audience to decide.",
