After class, you accidentally run into a conservative-looking girl wearing glasses. She introduces herself as Mizuho, but you can\u0027t help but notice her striking resemblance to your dream pop idol, Miho Nakayama. You pick up a good-luck charm Mizuho dropped to give back to her, then make a startling revelation - your photographer brother took a picture of Miho carrying the exact same charm! You go to the music room to confront her with this evidence - and this is where the true challenge of the game begins.",

But watch out! Make sure you have enough food for all of your feline friends or your hungry cats will subtract points from your score. \n \nThe player with the highest total victory points wins the game! \n \nCat Lady is very simple to play but with enough strategic depth to keep you coming back for more! \nWill you be the best Cat Lady?\"",

One point is earned for each successful catch. A dropped ball will display a broken ball and end the game. The object is to continuously catch the balls that fall and throw them back up, as in juggling.

Not knowing about his deadly allergy to plums, Skinny didn’t think twice about eating it, and immediately went into anaphylactic shock which caused his sudden death. Ronald ran off, terrified.\nWhen he woke up, Skinny discovered that he had become a skeleton and been sentenced to live in Ronald’s bedroom wardrobe forever. Since then, Skinny has watched over Ronald constantly, without his knowledge… but now things are going to change!\nTo save his best friend’s soul from eternal damnation, Skinny will be forced to reveal himself and make Ronald admit his \u0027crime\u0027. Not a simple challenge at all!",
    "summary": "The Wardrobe is a visually-rich 2D point and click adventure game inspired by the great ‘90s classics such as \u0027Monkey Island\u0027, \u0027Day of the Tentacle\u0027, \u0027Sam \u0026 Max: Hit the Road\u0027 and \u0027Tony Tough\u0027. The game has a strong sense of humour, but isn\u0027t shy about dealing with mature and non-politically correct themes.\n\n- More than 40 hand-illustrated and digitally colored locations, enriched by dozens of nerd quotes.\n- Tons of clever puzzles and inventory objects to collect!\n- Play as Skinny, a teen-skeleton with an impertinent attitude and a sparkling wit, willing to do anything to save his best friend’s soul from eternal damnation!",

You’ll lose yourself in settings inspired by the works of poets Keats, Byron, and Shelley, and use the game\u0027s system of writing prompts to help create your own masterpieces. Explore 27 different writing challenges, through which you create narratives about the worlds you visit, from multiple perspectives. In one challenge, you play an archaeologist, uncovering clues and writing about a city\u0027s final days; in another, you\u0027re a thief, composing a song about searching the wreckage for valuables; and in another, you\u0027re a bard penning a lament in rhyming couplets.",

    "summary": "The Donkey Kong Country Competition Cartridge is a cut-down competition variant of Donkey Kong Country manufactured for use in the Nintendo PowerFest \u002794 game competition and later featured in the Blockbuster World Video Game Championships II event. Following the end of the later contest, copies of the Competition cartridge were sold in a Nintendo Power subscribers catalogue. Due to its rarity (the back insert states the print run was of 2,500 copies), the game has become a prized collector item.\n\nThe actual game consists of a few select levels from Donkey Kong Country with the addition of a point counter and a few minor tweaks to encourage scoring, the goal being to score as many points as possible. The tree house and banana cave at the start of Jungle Hijinxs have been disabled and all of the animal tokens in the early levels have been replaced with banana bunches, making it impossible to reach the bonus round without the usage of a cheating device. The player is also given 50 starting extra lives instead of the 5 as in the original game. The game has a time limit of five minutes, which is displayed at the center of the screen. After the allotted time, the game freezes.",

It is rumored that a strong army has been created by a mysterious lord? \n \nYour prestige as one of the most brave and magnanimous kings is well known in these lands, and you have become a leader of the independent nations in the battle against this new menace. \n \nCourage and wisdom are your strengths... May the gods assist you!",
    "summary": "Cloven Crania Meadow is a real-time strategy game set in a standard fantasy world. The player takes control of the human kingdom, surrounded by hostile nations, monsters and other evil creatures. The solution to the problem is to beat the aggressive neighbors and the expulsion of monsters. Priority is to develop the city, ensuring prosperity, defend their headquarters and destroy enemy cities. It is important to train military units - only a large and well-trained army can deal with the army of the enemy. Battles emphasize taking control of \"key areas\" on the battlefield rather than simply destroying the opponent\u0027s army. The development of the capital consists of constructing important buildings and providing resources.",

If the missile detonates within range of an enemy missile, the enemy missile is destroyed. If all of the cities are destroyed, the player loses the game; if any cities survive, the player wins (better scores are earned for more remaining cities). Several skill levels are available which control the speed of the enemy missiles and the accuracy required for destroying missiles.",

    "storyline": "Lupine III and his inseparable companions Jigen and Goemon run to the rescue of the beautiful Fujiko who got into a big trouble: the woman was in fact kidnapped by the band of the Celestial Dragon at whose command is the ruthless Kourin, a terrible twenty year old with incomparable techniques of struggle and powerful performer of mysterious martial arts, which hits Lupine in a vital point with the deadly Dark blow, leaving the thief gentleman only three days of life. In order to save himself, Lupine must get hold of Sokai\u0027s treasure (it is said that there is a cure in the treasure that could heal from the dark blow), through a series of clues written in the Book, aka the Pink Crystals (accompanied by the Black Crystals in the second narrative strand of the game), which however are the prize up for the winner of the Miss Sokai competition. Fujiko signs up for the beauty contest, but a problem arises: it is the beautiful Ginrei, a girl so charming that she even arouses admiration of the impassive Goemon. As if this were not enough, the inspector Koichi Zenigata, bitter enemy of Lupine III, senses that the next target of the protagonist will be the Pink Crystals and then rushes to Ginrei to warn her about Lupine and to supervise her in order to keep her safe . The first encounter between Zenigata and Ginrei is not the best: she invites him to leave her alone because the young woman is convinced that she is out of any danger, while he considers her a vain girl and dad\u0027s daughter (not knowing that in reality the young it comes from the outskirts of Sokai, a very unreliable and above all very poor neighborhood). \n \nLupine, meanwhile, fearing that Ginrei could steal the title of winner from Fujiko, plans to sneak into the girl\u0027s hotel to secretly give her a dose of sleeping pill that will make her sleep for two days. But since Zenigata was there to guard the girl, the gentleman thief was tracked down twice (first in the restaurant where Zazzà and the girl had dinner, then in the young girl\u0027s apartment after Lupine had managed to escape all the policemen who were patrol), but both times he quickly manages to escape. In the meantime, the relationship between Ginrei and Zenigata is notably changing: between the two an agreement begins to arise, Zazà no longer thinks that the young woman is only a presumptuous egoist, while the latter sees in the inspector a figure that protects her and who is always present next to her in times of need. In other words, the spark of love began to ignite. \n \nThe day of Miko\u0027s competition arrives: Fujiko and Ginrei parade on the catwalk with elegance and, above all, unparalleled seduction. But between the two it is Fujiko to tick it, undoubtedly more loose and sexy than the opponent, decidedly more shy and reserved. Armed then with pink crystals and the blessed Miko (Fujiko), Lupine and the woman hurry to reach the Government Palace of Sokai where the treasure is said to be hidden. The protagonist escapes all the traps and deadly traps hidden by the building; Meanwhile Zenigata tries to improvise a speech to herself to console Ginrei, when suddenly she feels that she is talking to Kourin, the architect of the Dark Strike who sentenced Lupine to only three days of life. Zazzà discovers that Kourin is none other than Ginrei\u0027s brother, who wanted his sweet sister to win Miko\u0027s contest in order to obtain the Pink Crystals that will lead the terrible boy to Sokai\u0027s treasure. The inspector bursts into the room where Kourin and Ginrei are conversing, but the boss of the Celestial Dragon treacherously shoots the poor Zenigata, who fortunately manages to save himself thanks to the bulletproof vest he had worn to protect, if necessary, Ginrei. Kourin thus rushes to the Government Palace to prevent Lupine from taking possession of the treasure; the head of the celestial dragon reaches Fujiko and the protagonist, and informs the latter of the fact that the medicine capable of healing him from the Dark Strike is the so-called Fog Flower, a flower, in fact, capable of totally eliminating the effects of the terrible kill shot. To prevent the thief from continuing further, however, Kourin strikes Fujiko with the tremendous Dark Strike, unleashing the wrath of Lupine who, furious as ever, kills the boss of the Celestial Dragon gang through the blows of his infallible Walther P38 (in the second the final of the saga, instead is Zenigata to finish Kourin, to avenge the sufferings that the latter caused to his sister Ginrei). \n \nLupine thus manages to take over the flower of fog, making Fujiko drink the only purifying drop, which recovers and can barely see the smiling face of the thief, who falls apparently lifeless to the ground. Fortunately, the woman kisses the protagonist to thank him for saving her life,",

Players enjoy the classic motion-based controls popularized by We Ski using the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers, or by adding the increased realism of the Wii Balance Board for even more ski and snowboard action. Custom characters and player Mii\u0027s add even more dimension to snow-capped adventures across even more mountain terrain than ever with vast free-riding areas. Leisurely gondola rides to sloping peaks invite a breathtaking panoramic experience, while heli-drops from extreme dizzying heights offer-up opportunities to shred down vertical cliffs and severe precipices. Players should be sure to watch out for avalanches! \n \n \n \nHot Doggers can quench their thirst for excitement with half-pipe courses, and ski technique challenges, while loungers can look forward to other activities including ski school, board school, moguls and slaloms, as well as animal search and rescue. Players can enjoy the sprawling vistas with day, night and dusk skiing, offering countless nuances to an ever-expanding list of experiences. The whole family can still enjoy fast-paced racing action or free-skiing with four-player fun, while single players can enjoy the ride with up to three AI-controlled skiing buddies.",

World War II has finally ended and celebrations continue… Yet, somewhere in the middle of New Mexico, a secret intricate plot to extinguish humanity has been unraveling for a long time. Even if it could be stopped, what hope is there when inexplicably, no one can remember a thing? Tonight, step into Betty’s shoes and find out exactly what happens at ‘3 Minutes to Midnight’.” \nImagine, if you will, being woken in the middle of the night by a deafening sound and the entire house shaking to its core. A scary enough thought in its own, wouldn’t you say? But what if you then realized you had no idea what year it was, where, or even who you were? Well, that’s the stuff of nightmares… \n \nUnfortunately, if you hadn’t already guessed, this isn’t just some bad dream that you can shake off and drift lazily back to sleep. No, this is your heart sinking, gut wrenching, terrifying new reality. \n \nA young lady, Betty Anderson, alone in the world and a stranger in her own mind, it now rests on your narrow shoulders to figure out what’s happening. Any thoughts you may harbor about running away, well, since you don’t even know where you are, where would you run to. Hmm? \n \nInstead, let’s presume you’re made of sterner stuff and begin searching for an explanation. Maybe someone nearby will give you the answers you seek or even go far as to offer some insight of their own. Either way, you can only hope that whatever caused the ringing in your ears is the only thing that goes bump in the night… \n \nLet’s be honest though, that’s not how these things tend to pan out, is it?",

As the starship falls, Sam reads the coordinates and frets about crash-landing into Egypt again, but instead he crashes into Central America in the Mayan age, with the starship now heavily damaged upon impact. However, not all hope is lost, since the Sirians left a \"back-up starship\" on Earth, which was a fail-safe in case anything ever happened to the SSS Centerprice. However, since this back-up starship is located in a different time and age than where and when Sam currently is, he will have to uncover the locations of the Sirian portals that will help him reach his destination.",

    "summary": "James Pond, also known as James Pond: Underwater Agent, is a platform video game that was developed by British video game developers Vectordean Ltd and Millennium Interactive, and published by Millennium Interactive and Electronic Arts for numerous home computers and consoles in 1990. The character was popular and even featured in some comic books of the time, and the game was successful enough to spawn two sequels and one spin-off game.\n\nA nefarious supervillain named \"Doctor Maybe\" (a pun on the name of Dr Julius No, the villain in Dr. No) has overtaken the ruthless megacorporation Acme Oil Co, and is not only filling the oceans with radiation and toxic waste but even threatening all the world from his underwater lair. The protagonist of the story and player character of the game is an intelligent, mutated anthropomorphic mudskipper who is given the name \"James Pond\" (after the legendary spy James Bond) and hired by the British Secret Service to protect the seas and take out the bad guys in underwater areas. He is also suave enough to seduce numerous attractive mermaids, some of whom act as double agents as is common with James Bond\u0027s love interests. The game spoofs James Bond movies with levels mimicking their titles, with level names like \"License to Bubble\" (after Licence to Kill), \"A View to a Spill\" (after A View to a Kill), \"Leak and Let Die\" (after Live and Let Die) and \"From Three Mile Island with Love\" (after From Russia with Love).",
