Most of the population remains unaware of their abuses of power, but to the most enigmatic order of the beloved Septian Church, the Gralsritter, snuffing out these would-be villains and claiming artifacts in their name is as everyday as professing one’s faith in the Goddess.\n\nOn the eve of another successfully completed mission, high-ranking member Father Kevin Graham is immediately assigned to retrieve one more artifact that rests beneath Grancel Cathedral. What’s more, even though this is a task he could easily complete on his own, he must reluctantly do so in partnership with his newest recruit, rookie Gralsritter and childhood friend Sister Ries Argent.\n\nThus begins the start of a routine mission that becomes anything but, delving into a new and mysterious realm that follows an unnaturally strict set of rules: Phantasma. Therein, the history of the Septian Church and the pasts of the many familiar faces who took up arms for the sake of Liberl’s future will be laid bare…and some may have been better off staying forever sealed behind closed doors.\"",

Set in a different universe from the original Mazinger story, the story begins in the year 1999 AD, when God Kaiser Hell began an all-out invasion to control Earth using powerful giants known as \u0027Bio Beasts\u0027. Mazinger Z in Mazin Saga is actually a suit of armor rather than a robot. This armor has the ability to transform into a giant version of itself, allowing Mazinger Z to battle the Bio Beasts.\n\nMazinger Z\u0027s design in Mazin Saga is a departure from the rest of the Mazingers. Here, Mazinger Z is given an all-blue color rather than black in white like the others. Colored orbs are mounted on Mazinger Z\u0027s crown and torso. In many instances, Mazinger Z dons a red cape and its only weapon in combat is a sword, similar to God Mazinger.\n\nThe characters from the original Mazinger Z series reprise their roles in Mazin Saga, albeit slightly different from their anime/manga counterparts. Dr. Hell appears in Mazin Saga as God Kaiser Hell. Koji Kabuto still plays the protagonist, but has as darker, more serious persona than featured in the anime and manga versions of Mazinger Z. Even Garada K7, one of the earliest enemies Mazinger Z fought in the original series, reappears as a Bio Beast.",

It\u0027s as simple as speaking into the microphone that connects to your controller. If Pikachu understands you, he\u0027ll respond. The little yellow pocket monster has a vocabulary of approximately 200 words, and Professor Oak is even on hand to train you in the ways of creature communication. Wake up Pikachu each day by shouting \"Good Morning!\" and decide what games to play and activities to engage in. You can play Pokémon trivia on the in-game TV, gather food, hunt for treasure, collect seemingly endless goodies, go fishing, baby-sit Caterpie, and much more. You\u0027ll also play a variety of mini-games while guiding Pikachu along with friendly commands. As you bond and converse with your cartoon pal you\u0027ll investigate the Ochre Woods, head for the campground, check out Bulbasaur\u0027s picnic, and even solve clever puzzles. HEY YOU, PIKACHU! is an interactive romp that gives the younger set a chance to get up close and personal with their favorite Pokémon character.",

The amulet is thought to be somewhere beneath the Valley of the Dead.\n\nThankfully, very few actions are mandatory, many features are randomized, and there are many ways to achieve almost anything. This adds to the strategic challenge and makes the game interesting to replay. As a side effect, there is almost no \"story\" in the sense of most other games.",

The main dungeon is longer in SLASH\u0027EM than in NetHack but the Gehennom is shorter.",

It is the third video game to be based on Jim Davis\u0027 Garfield Comics \n \nThe game is a sidescrolling action game in which enemies can be mice, spiders, birds and other assorted animals. Garfield\u0027s default attack is a low judo-style kick when he is standing on his hind feet. There are also several powerups that are limited to how many Garfield has the ability to pick up. A time limit prevents players from wandering aimlessly throughout the level looking for power-ups.",

While moving around this edge the ship is protected from the aliens by a shield indicated by a glowing circle around the ship. This shield is not infinite and care should be taken to complete each level as quickly as possible. A counter indicates the level of shield that you have: when it reaches zero then any contact with an alien is deadly whether you are on the \u0027Shield Line\u0027 or not.\nThe idea of the game is to cut areas out of the screen without touching any of the aliens. This is done by pressing the SPACE key which initiates the \u0027Laser Cutter\u0027 and moving off the \u0027Shield Line\u0027 and rejoining it somewhere else. While you are in the process of drawing a line, your shield is inactive and touching an alien is fatal. Similarly, if one of the aliens touches the line then it will send a charge down the line towards you and you must quickly return to the safety of the edge before it reaches you.\n\nWhen you rejoin the \u0027Shield Line\u0027 the area that does not contain the \u0027Boss\u0027 alien will be filled (points are gained by trapping the other aliens) and the \u0027Shield Line\u0027 will be adjusted to surround the area that is left. The level is completed when a certain percentage of the total area has been filled in. This percentage starts at 80% but may increase in the later levels.",

From here it is possible to select one of various attacks; naturally, as the game goes on the pilots can learn new attacks. Unusually for an RPG there is also the option to just talk with the rogue Labor\u0027s pilot and try to convince them to back down - as a policeman, sometimes this is the only way forward.",

The innovative auto-targeting system locks on to any enemies in your area and makes for some straightforward killing. However, don\u0027t think it\u0027s going to be easy, as you will have to dodge enemy gunfire at the same time.\n\nEventually, your character will use up his Energon supply and you will have to refuel by transforming into Beast mode. While in Beast mode you cannot attack, and your sole purpose is to find power-ups to restore your Energon. BEAST WARS offers 10 different transformers to choose from, each with their own traits.\n\nYou\u0027ll also have the chance to battle in four different environments, each having its own set of enemies. With 24 missions to play and eight bonus missions, you\u0027ll have plenty to keep you occupied.",

The objectives remain the same as well, though some differences exist along the way. For example, in the beginning, the player is not given an option of choosing one of three starters. Instead, a wild Pikachu that Professor Oak catches becomes player\u0027s Pokémon, while the rival character takes an Eevee that was intended for the player. The plot takes from the anime, and features characters that were not featured in the game or have been enhanced to resemble their anime characters, including Jessie, James, Meowth, Nurse Joy and Officer Jenny. Similar to the anime, Pikachu refuses to evolve. Players are also given the opportunity to obtain the original three starters. As players quest on, they collect more Pokémon and use them to defeat the eight Gym Leaders and eventually the Elite Four, all the while battling Team Rocket, a gang devoted to using Pokémon in order to make themselves more powerful.",
    "summary": "An enhanced version of Pokémon Red and Blue Versions, Pokémon Yellow brings the video game experience closer to the Pokémon Anime by allowing you to start the game with your very own Pikachu following you around on-foot and collect the 3 other starters from strangers you meet around the region. However, your goal remains the same: catch them all and become the ultimate Pokémon Master.",

At that time, the evil Emperor Penguin happened to meet one of his subjects, Lucytesse, of matchless beauty, and he fell madly in love with her. \n \nHis love was unrequited, though. She only had eyes for her beloved Pentaro, a young good-looking penguin from the neighborhood. They were a happy couple but the Emperor, in a fit of rage and jealousy, kidnapped Lucytesse, and carried her off to his palace at the South Pole. \n \nPentaro departed swiftly to rescue her and, after countless perils and adventures in the ice and crevices of the South Pole, finally succeeded in reaching the Emperor\u0027s palace and rescuing his sweetheart. \n \nThey lived happily together for a while, far from the realms of the Emperor. But he had not had his final say. His revenge would consist of keeping the merry couple apart, kidnapping Pentaro this time and secluding him in a far-off place of his kingdom, far from the South Pole, lost in the boundaries of his realms and utterly unknown to our penguin. He was hoping that Pentaro\u0027s own desperation, far from his beloved and unable to escape, would become a punishment worse than death. \n \nHis cruelty knew no bounds. But Pentaro refused to resign himself to the fate the Emperor had planned for him. After overcoming numerous hazards amid the lava caverns, underground passageways and rivers, he managed to escape; not even the raging opposition from the island inhabitants who, fearful of the wrath of the Emperor, tried to keep Pentaro at any price, could hold him. \n \nIt did not take him long to realize that the unknown place from which he had just escaped was actually located on an island, thanks to the map he had gotten during his confinement. He himself could hardly have imagined how useful it would turn out to be one day... \n \nPentaro will have to escape from the island if he wants to meet up with his beloved Lucytesse ever again. To do, he is counting on your help!",

    "storyline": "ARC Continuum entered Steam Greenlight in September 2015 and was approved within a week. Since then we have made immense progress and fine-tuned the gameplay mechanics, the artwork and we are very excited as we move closer to release. Traditionally, multiplayer games have used the client-server model to handle gameplay, artificial intelligence and physics. To support a large user base, companies must maintain large server farms provisioned for maximum throughput — a costly architecture that has a significant impact on your bottom line. Our fault tolerant distributed networking middleware eliminates the need for such server farms. An major advantage of our patent pending technology is the ability to detect cheats, reduce latency and correct network problems in real-time.\tArc Continuum will be the first game to debut Akimbo Creations distributed networking middleware technology.",
    "summary": "ARC Continuum is a third person action adventure set on Taraan, a desert planet with a mystical energy at its core that powers the ARC - a device that allows you to control and manipulate the fabric of time. Take the role of our hero, Hadrian who is thrust into the midst of a revolution on the rise, where he must master the powers of time to free his people from the bondages of oppression from the evil Kasaar.",

The face of the earth has been scarred by climate change and many great cities have been submerged due to the rising oceans. Sindome is all about playing a role in the struggle of the haves versus the have-nots. Characters fight for survival, carving out a niche in the underworld for themselves. \n \nFrom the Sindome website: \n \nThe corporations have grown larger than the countries they were once entities of, their wealth and power allowing them to build a refuge away from the chaos that has befallen the globe. Once invested in their failed salvation, a city was born out of their necessity to turn a profit. The blood, sweat and very lives of the first citizens a testament to the inequality that has existed since its birth, the city teems with the overflowing masses of corporate drones and ramshackle destitute. With the law empowering its patrolmen to be judge, jury and executioner, the haves have a distinct advantage over the population that is forbidden from owning fire-arms themselves.",
    "summary": "Sindome is a cyberpunk MOO (a text-based online virtual reality system to which multiple users are connected at the same time). Roleplaying in Sindome is unique in that most of its coding is custom, employing XML, File-IO, custom web based websocket powered game client (optional), and a graphical web interface. Sindome has been online since 1997. \nThe Sindome world is based on the cyberpunk genre of science fiction. Sindome draws its inspiration from books, movies, and traditional role-playing games like: William Gibson\u0027s Neuromancer, Count Zero, Virtual Light, Idoru, \"Burning Chrome\"; Neal Stephenson\u0027s Snow Crash; Bruce Sterling\u0027s Mirrorshades, Richard K Morgan\u0027s Altered Carbon and Islands in the Net; R.

He has been warned by Zobek of the return of Satan and sets out to regain his powers so that he may face Satan once again. The key to him regaining his power lies in his castle. However, the famed Belmont clan and his son Alucard seek his ultimate destruction.",
    "summary": "Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 is an action-adventure game and a sequel to the 2010 game, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow, and the 35th installment on the Castlevania franchise. The game was developed by MercurySteam and published by Konami. This is MercurySteam\u0027s last contribution to the franchise. The story is set in both medieval and modern worlds.\n\nAs in the previous game, the player controls Gabriel Belmont, now known as Dracula, as he fights through an open world. During the game\u0027s opening sequence the player is able to control Dracula while he still possesses all his powers as well as all of his weapons. Dracula\u0027s main weapon is his Blood Whip, a weapon that is comparable to the Combat Cross from the original Lords of Shadow. Replacing the magic system from the previous game are the Void Sword and the Chaos Claws. The Void Sword can replenish Dracula\u0027s health when used while the Chaos Claws can be used to break through enemy defenses and deliver powerful attacks. The story mode in Lords of Shadow 2 has been stated to be far longer than the previous one. The game is mainly an open world allowing the player to choose what route to take. This game also features a movable camera, something that was not available in the first Lords of Shadow game.",

Every chapter will have various goals set. Only one specific goal per chapter is required to complete the chapter so you can always replay the chapter later to try to complete all the goals. \n \nEvery stage will also require you to play as a different character and some will involve all characters. \n \nEach character have their own unique abilities: Marty can kick with his hind legs, sneak around his enemies slide and perform long-jumps. Alex the lion can throw fruits, use his claws and roar at his enemies. Gloria can tumble, butt bounce and hip check her enemies. And when she eats some chili peppers, she will be able to charge into her enemies. Melman can spin into, throw items at and head bash his enemies. He can also perform the Helicopter move which enables him to glide long distances. Finally the Penguin can slide, fish and attack with a Finishing move (something like a karate chop) to defeat their enemies. \n \nThroughout the game there will be various items to collect including Life Tikis to replenish your Health Meter and Monkey Money that will enable you to buy special things at the Zoovenir Shop like mini games and special outfits for the Madagascar cast.",

The wars, famines and suffering of the last 20 millennia were to become a distant, fading memory, as scientific advances brought global peace and prosperity. Toward the end of the 20th century, a now forgotten US president even went so far as to officially proclaim the arrival of a New World Order, in which right, not might, would govern international relations. This bright future was not to be. First came a meltdown of the international stock and currency exchanges. Then the major international conglomerates were dissolved in a vain attempt to stop the fiscal hemorrhage. By 2012 the world economy had collapsed. Poverty and hunger caused social and political tensions to flare. As the crisis wore on, few were bold or naive enough to predict anything positive for the future. Most realized that the planet was on the verge of global conflict.\n\nIn 2048, the anticipated global conflict broke out with a violence that shook the planet to its core. All major centralized governments were destroyed in the maelstrom. Europe and Eastern Asia bore the brunt of the devastation, as entire urban centres, from Madrid to Moscow and from Seoul to Singapore were literally wiped off the map. \nThe human race has always been known for its resiliency. Within a dozen years, the Earth\u0027s inhabitants had begun to restore their old nationalities - with a few twists. Twelve states of the former United States joined together to form a new country, called the United Civilized States. The UCS citizens had essentially given up their old roles as producers and leaders. Nearly all work was being performed by robots which are controlled by expert computer systems. Not surprisingly, the human inhabitants of the UCS had become lazy and decadent.\n\nThe 20th-century dream for a better world had ended in death and destruction.EARTH 2150: THE MOON PROJECTThe year 2150 … one of the blackest chapters in the history of mankind. While the Lunar Corporation, Eurasian Dynasty and the United Civilized States are preparing themselves for the last all-encompassing battle, work is being feverishly carried out on a secret project on the Moon. Only the code name of this project is known ………… \"SUNLIGHT\"EARTH 2150: LOST SOULSIt is the 7th of December 2150 – in a few hours our beloved planet Earth will no longer exist.\nDevastating wars between the Eurasian Dynasty and the United Civilized States have wreaked havoc and caused mortal wounds to our planet, but that is not all, a series of nuclear explosions close to the Antarctic had changed the Earth’s orbit around the sun, glaciers melted, the sea rose to a threatening level, and meteorite showers buried whole parts of the world. Famous scientists from the Lunar corporation, a long forgotten colony on the moon first recognized the signs of the imminent catastrophe. According to their calculations  the distance between the sun and earth would decrease in the next few years by 17%, which would lead to terrible consequences.\n\nThe only hope left for the population was the escape to the red planet Mars. Hurry up, cause time is ticking away....",

Originally, Qureshi was going to create a simple, non-terrifying apartment due to its simultaneous simplicity, familiarity and variety of objects it would contain. However, since the workshop is aimed at game developers, Qureshi decided to attempt to recreate the infamous haunted hallway. You can see screenshots of his impressive work above, or visit his page for a step-by-step breakdown of how he managed this impressive feat (in four weeks by himself, no less).",
