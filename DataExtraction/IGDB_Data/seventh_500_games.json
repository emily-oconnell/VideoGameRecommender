    "summary": "A Famicom game developed by Bandai as part of their Family Trainer series, which all use the Family Trainer (Power Pad) accessory. The goal is to explore mazes.\n\nThe fifth in Bandai\u0027s series of Family Trainer games, created for the accessory with the same name (or Power Pad in the US). Unlike the others, which tended to be athletics/exercise games, Meiro Daisakusen (\"Epic Maze Battle\") is a maze-exploring light RPG where the goal is to walk and jump around mazes to find items and, eventually, the exit.\n\nThe game\u0027s controls are dictated entirely by the Family Trainer/Power Pad. Different buttons will either cause the protagonist to jump, walk forward, walk backwards, turn left or right or switch their position to the left, right or center of the screen. While searching for the exit, players must be mindful of the various enemies that also inhabit the mazes, most of which must be avoided by jumping over them or running past them.",

The people get more and more controlled by and evil force. Revolutions and wars arise. The formerly united kingdom divides. Finally, the old king finds out that a goddess called \"Medusa\" tries to control the people from out of the underworld, in order to conquer and rule the entire world with her army from hell. \nThe player who takes the role of the prince is forced to stop Medusa\u0027s advance and to reunite the split kingdom. To reach that, he must fight against the goddess Medusa and defeat her again. As the opponent is a goddess, the player is not able to find her anywhere in the country. He can only call her when he finds 5 rings, puts them together in a temple and forces Medusa to face a fight. The basic task is therefore the search for the 5 rings. Unfortunately the king has very little energy, and so the starting conditions for his son do not look very good. First he has to earn some money to afford an army which is necessary to find the rings. This causes more problems, which the player realizes and includes in the course of the game.",

Like Sony\u0027s Gran Turismo franchise, Forza games are racing simulations; heavy emphasis is placed on making the cars drive and look as realistic as possible. Races are conducted on closed circuit tracks. 500 cars are featured in the core game experience, ranging from road cars to race cars. \n \nPlayers can utilize Kinect to look into a corner using a new head tracking feature. This allows them to look toward the apex of a corner or at nearby cars. The controller or steering wheel is used to control the car while Kinect is used independently for viewing around the driver. Players can also use Kinect as a game controller. In this setting the game automatically accelerates and decelerates the player\u0027s vehicle utilizing a modified version of the feature known as Auto Brake in Forza Motorsport 3. The steering is controlled by placing the players arms out as if controlling an invisible steering wheel. Kinect will allow the player to use voice commands to start races and navigate menus.",

When that word reached the King\u0027s ear, for in fear of the return of the Dark Arcane Wielders, newly crowned King, Garlen Hastein, swiftly rallied his troops and his most faithful protectors, the Crimson Guard to march on Necore Tower.\n\nIn an attempt to avoid detection by whomever or whatever had tainted the tower, Garlen brought his troops to the rear entrance of the tower. The pilgrim\u0027s entrance.\n\nHowever, it seemed that it was all in vain, as no sooner had Garlen entered the clearing, a tree, that had been standing strong for millennia, fell, nearly crushing him and those behind him to death. Upon further investigation, the tree had been warded with ancient magic, an ancient magic that made Garlen shiver.\n\nTrapped now with limited supplies, a few of his Crimson Guard and Samuel Blackthorn his Family\u0027s most entrusted protector. Garlen must ascend the tower and defeat whatever may be waiting for him.\n\nBut, can it be done?....",

The teams are updated, with the sides present in the 92-93 European tournaments included, and the player names updated to take transfers into account.\n\nThe game was tidied up and changed in a number of areas. The most significant change is the addition of red and yellow cards for discipline (2 yellow card offenses or one ‘professional foul’ (denying your opponent a clear goal-scoring opportunity) results in that player being sent off). The goalkeepers have been improved in skill, and the 1994 World Cup Qualifying tournament was added.\n\nThis is the version that would be ported to various consoles, such as the SNES, Genesis, and in North America under the title \"Championship Soccer \u002794\".",

This cartridge adds a pretty title screen and one new game to the three already offered by Word Fun. \nAlthough the basic gameplay of the Word Hunt, Word Rockets and Crosswords games appears unchanged from the original Word Fun cartridge, the graphics were enhanced. According to the official site, a bug was introduced in the Crosswords game that resulted in the computer only choosing words starting with letters A-T instead of A-Z. The new game added to the mix is Memory Fun - your basic \u0027Memory\u0027 style game where you turn over pairs of tiles to find matches. Another grand edutainment game. No wonder they made so many. ;-)",

Apartment: A Separated Place is an intimate look at Nick\u0027s state of mind as he picks through the wreckage of his relationship with Madison. Join him as he seeks self-consolation in the apartment they once shared. Venture outside to visit his neighbors: a displaced loner, a lost daughter, a grieving widow, an uncertain newlywed. Enter their apartments — their lives, their relationships, their innermost thoughts — as they seek their own resolutions.",
    "summary": "a•part•ment is a story-driven game, a bit like an interactive novel or movie where the way you play helps to tell the story rather than giving you power over it. We wanted to create a strong connection between you, the player, and the characters whose stories are told in the game. Different sections of a•part•ment have different mechanics that put you in the lives of the characters you play. In some sections you actively build the story, in others the story is in the environment and unfolds as you progress through it.",

After a brief stay at the Sacred Bird Cosmos, the fledgling cosmos has become hospitable and manifested its first planet. The new Queen and her aide monitor their growing if lifeless realm together in their newly built palace. \n \nOne day, a powerful entity calling himself \"the Emperor\" invades the Sacred Bird Cosmos to conquer it for himself. He separates the Sacred Guardians and converts the residents of her home planet into monsters. With the weakening Queen forced into hiding, Rosalia hurries to the Queen of the Sacred Beast Cosmos for assistance. Rosalia gives the protagonist clothes for combat and a legendary rod, Ellicia the Gray, to prepare her for her journey. The protagonist must locate her allies and rescue the Queen of the Sacred Bird Cosmos from the Emperor.",
    "summary": "Angelique Tenkuu no Requiem is the first Neoromance role-playing game. Canonically this game is the direct sequel to Angelique Special 2 and Angelique Maren no Rokukishi. \n \nRuby Party members later commented that its conception began when written questionnaires indicated a high demand for a Koei role-playing game, a genre which experienced a boost in popularity due to titles such as Final Fantasy VI and Final Fantasy VII. Since Team-Infinite was simultaneously developing a game for male appeal, Ruby Party was given the inquiry for an Angelique adaptation targeting the female side. \n \nThe Premium Box edition includes a fully colored leather-bound manual. Consumers who purchased this title during Koei\u0027s 1999 double campaign obtained an original clear file.",

This means you can take a better job offer at any time, if you ever get one.\n\n- Be your own Boss\n\nYou know what\u0027s best for you. Choose your own hours! Choose 80 of them every week if you want!\n\n- Meet new people\n\nThere are people diving with Oonder, LLC for all kinds of reasons. You will encounter people of all ages and from some backgrounds diving for cash.\n\n- Listen to music while you work\n(Note: Oonder is not responsible for collisions that occur while diver is distracted, and will not respond to inquiries related to incidents)\n\nEvery year, billions of dollars in assets are lost to the deep. By diving with Oonder, you can do your part to recover some of those losses for some of the biggest, most important business entities on the planet. Awesome!\n\nWe\u0027ll even lend you a submarine.\n\nOnce you sign our user agreement, you\u0027ll receive your very own decommissioned nuclear submarine, retrofitted with some of the equipment necessary to dive for loot. No need to thank us.",
    "summary": "Working Tidal is a Sega Dreamcast inspired, loot grabbing, time attack game built for Haunted PS1\u0027s Summer of Shivers game jam.\n\nIn it, you\u0027ll be given control of a submarine with a limited fuel supply and tasked with diving into various oceanic locations for lost, forgotten, and valuable artifacts as part of a gig for a salvage company.\n\nYou can return to locations you\u0027ve previously unlocked, upgrade your submarine, and view detailed descriptions and models of the items you\u0027ve found in-game from the main menu.\n\nThere are several locations to explore, as well as some narrative segments to see. Total runtime should come in at under an hour, unless you really enjoy your new job.",

    "storyline": "The narrative is primarily told through in-engine cutscenes at the beginning or end of each mission, and they\u0027re visually stylish - their dramatic camera angles and lighting effects approach film quality at times, though the flat dialogue amongst the characters can be tedious. \n \nThe tone of the missions tends to be realistic: While David Jones is a skilled agent, he\u0027s just one man - not a one-man army. As such, he\u0027ll need to do a lot of creeping through the shadows, sneaking around security cameras, hacking computers to deactivate surveillance systems, and using binoculars to scout the area.",
    "summary": "Project I.G.I.: I\u0027m Going In (released in Europe as simply Project I.G.I.) is a tactical first-person shooter developed by Innerloop Studios and released on December 15, 2000 by Eidos Interactive. It is one of the first computer games to feature realistic weaponry and tactical combat situations. \n \nPursue and defeat a homicidal ex-Russian Colonel before she turns Europe into a nuclear wasteland in Project IGI: I\u0027m Going In. This first-person shooter emphasizes stealth and guile instead of massive firepower. Jones has to sneak into the toughest military installations in Eastern Europe, and once inside, use his skills in thievery, computer hacking, sabotage, and reconnaissance to stop the madwoman. The enemy\u0027s Artificial Intelligence will react to his every action and use military tactics to track his position. In order to counter its surveillance, bunkers, tanks, and gunships, Jones is equipped with NATO spy gear and assault weapons. If the odds get stacked too high against him, he can call in a napalm strike via his Map Computer. \n \nUpon release the game garnered mixed reviews due to a number of shortcomings, such as poorly programmed Artificial intelligence, lack of a mid-game save option, and the lack of multiplayer features. However it was praised for its superb sound design and graphics, thanks in part to its use of a proprietary game engine that was previously used in Innerloop\u0027s Joint Strike Fighter. It was followed up in 2003 by I.G.I.-2: Covert Strike.",

Each time the program is started, viewers will see scenes in a different order and sometimes even completely new ones. \n \nBy clicking the player/viewer directs the clan through the different worlds, based on the animations of Terry Gilliam. Clicking on objects or bringing the clan to certain locations trigger several kinds of events. Many encounters take place and each one requires a different reaction. But life in this Python world changes over time as well. As many as 13 different games are hidden in this world of Python, mostly based on specific sketches that still influence our perception of humour and the use of language. Players can earn points, which enables them to view sketches and clips in the cinema. This can be entered by clicking on the score sheep. But also during the exploration of the different scenes videoclips from the television series can be seen and every now and then the program is being interrupted for an intermission, among which a number of commercial ones. If players decide to leave the game they are enabled to visit the scenes they have gone through again. This way players can experience favourite scenes once more.",

As the player, you are given the responsibility of creating Dinos and building places for them to live in the city. You can also use your Dinos to battle against other humans\u0027 Dinos through a system known as Dino Net. Battles take place on a virtual grid where both teams cannot see the other until they choose to attack. The battle system is quite different from other RPGs in this sense, with strategic elements resembling Battleship and Minesweeper. For battling, Dinos are capable of equipping specialized weapons and armor known as Devices. Devices boost a Dino\u0027s stats in battle and also give them a special attack, effectively allowing the player to customize the Dino\u0027s strengths and moveset.",

    "summary": "The goal in Narrow Escape is to successfully navigate a ship through the narrow, fast-moving passages of the warlord\u0027s fortress, destroy the defense forces and avoid space debris. The player\u0027s ship must also be maneuvered through small holes in a series of walls where fuel cells can be picked up to restore the ship\u0027s constantly decreasing fuel supply. If the player pilots their ship successfully, they will be faced with the warlord\u0027s own escape ship which must be hit several times to be destroyed, liberating the star system from the warlord\u0027s tyranny. \n \nEach level becomes more difficult as everything will move faster, fuel will be consumed more quickly, the holes in the walls will become smaller, and more menacing defense forces will appear. \n \nEach level of game play consists of two phases: \n \n1. Passages: During the first phase of each level, the player must maneuver their ship through the narrow, moving passages with the joystick while shooting six of the warlord\u0027s defense forces with button 4. If any of the six are missed, they will go off-screen and be recycled to give the player another chance, but more fuel will be used. In addition to various defense forces which must be destroyed, there are extra targets that can be shot for additional points. Unlike the regular defense forces, the extra targets are non-threatening in that they will not shoot or crash into the player\u0027s ship. During this phase, space debris will also be shooting up through the play field. Space debris cannot be shot and can only be avoided by dodging it by moving from side to side. The walls of the narrow passage are also a danger to the player. If the player\u0027s ship crashes into a wall, a life will be lost. There are gaps between the moving walls which the player can maneuver quickly into and out of so as to avoid approaching enemies or space debris, however as game play becomes faster this will present a higher risk to crashing into oncoming walls. \n \n2. Walls: If the passages are successfully navigated and the the required six defense forces are destroyed, the player will enter the second phase. This is a series of walls with holes. In the first level of the game, there are five successive walls, each with one hole through which the player must maneuver their ship. In the second level of play, there will be six successive walls, in the third level, seven walls, etc. Also the size of the holes will become smaller in each new level. The hole will be in a different location on each wall. After passing through the hole in each wall (but prior to entering the hole in the next wall) there will be a fuel cell which must be passed to pick up. If the fuel cells are missed, the game will continue, but the fuel gauge will be continuously depleting. Note: in early levels of the game, all of the fuel cells will not need to be captured. However as the game progresses and fuel is consumed faster, all of the fuel cells will need to be captured in order to make it through the next level. \n \nAfter successfully completing three levels of play, the player will come face-to-face with the warlord\u0027s escape ship in open space. The warlord\u0027s ship must be shot five times to be destroyed during the first encounter, seven times on the next encounter, nine times the next, etc. The warlord\u0027s ship will shoot torpedoes at the player\u0027s ship, which can be either avoided or shot at to be destroyed. If the warlord\u0027s escape ship is destroyed, the player will enter the next level of play and the game will continue.",

    "summary": "According to the TAD president, Tadashi Yokoyama: One day in December 1988, a freelance artist came at TAD with a portfolio of designs including this monkey. The team was motivated to do a game around this funny monkey. \n \nOn February 02, 1989, the first prototype was ready: one level, no enemies, no musics and the monkey can jump only (no shoot). At this point, they decided to reprogram the game entirely from 0. Note JuJu Densetsu was coded with the same system used by the neogeo coders at SNK. \n \nDuring the first location test (at the TAD office) on September 07, 1989, many new ideas came to the developers but most of them were not included in the final product (i.e: snakes on the first stage), because lack of time. \n \nOn September 15, 1989. a public location test was done in Japan AND in the USA (University of Washington). A second test was done in October. After this test, they decided to program the end of the game (done by a non-programmer in a week-end). Note: The girl you have to save is brune in the attract mode and blonde at the end. \n \nThe game was finished on November 06, 1989. \n \nThen, after about 10 months of development, JuJu Densetsu was finally released on December 08, 1989 in Japan by TAD. 3148 arcade boards were sold. Export releases: \"Toki\". \n \nThe title of this game translates from Japanese as \u0027Legend of JuJu\u0027. \n \nThe devil monkey with horns from the level 2 is called Bellzador (Dev. code name: Akuma Zaru) and has the most complex AI routine. It takes 27 pages \u0027A4\u0027 format in the source code. Its desing and patern were inspired by Red Arremer from Makaimura. \n \nThere is some unused sprites for the character\u0027s animation in the game code. \n \nOn February 26, 1990, TAD know that pirate versions of their game appear on the market. \n \nThis was the last video game developed by TAD. A sequel was planned (JuJu 2! an action puzzle game) for the Super Famicom but the company closed its door 2 months after the JuJu Desnsetsu release. Fortunately, the source code of JuJu 2 was sold to Altron Corp. who released the game as \"Little Magic [Model SHVC-LI]\". \n \nSource: Arcade-History",

The king had counted on the fact that the prince would eventually forget about her, but his plans were ruined when his heir died in battle, and the prince’s beloved wife gave birth to a child and died in confinement. After the death of his son, the king sank into mourning, and the future of the royal line was thrown into uncertainty.

    "summary": "Eve Zero is a prequel to Eve Burst Error. Once again, the player controls the two main heroes of the series: the witty and womanizing private investigator Kojiroh Amagi, and the beautiful red-haired secret agent Marina. The events of the game take place shortly before those of Eve Burst Error. Kojiroh is working at Katsuragi Detective Office together with his girlfriend Yayoi. Dr. Nishina, the head of a genetic research facility, hires Kojiroh to investigate the disappearance of his son Shin. At the same time, Marina receives an assignment from her boss Kohno, which involves watching over a representative of an American company. As in all EVE games, the two stories appear unrelated in the beginning and are gradually linked together later in the game.\n\nThe player needs to switch between the two protagonists frequently in order to advance in the game. The interface consists of a menu that makes it possible to interact with the game world. Beside the traditional \"Look\", \"Talk\", and \"Go\" commands, there are many others, specific to the situation. Being a Japanese-style adventure game, Eve Zero does not feature any puzzles.",

If you place two pieces of the same color together they will mend together into one piece.\n\nThere are six game modes: Solo Normal Game, Solo Scoring Marathon, Solo vs. Computer, 2 Players @ 1 Keyboard, 2 Players. Use Network, Computer vs. Computer. If the standard tetris pieces feels too uninteresting to play with you can select to play with two other sets of pieces: \"Planar Pantominoes\" and \"One-To-Five-Ominoes\". To make the game even more interesting you can activate the \"Power Pieces\"-option. A Power Piece can be one of four different kinds: The bomb (destroys all adjacent tiles), The Down (pushes each tile directly beneath it down as far as it can go), The Drip (all non-garbage tiles adjacent to it change to be the color most commonly occurring on the board) and The Skull (destroys all non-garbage tiles adjacent to it).\n\nAs standard there is no sound in the game but the user can add his/her own sound. The graphic style of the game can also be changed. There are 12 built in styles and additional styles can be created by the user.",

Yūji has also been terrorizing Hanazono High School, so Riki joins Kunio as well, provided that another player has another copy of the game and the Game Link Cable. Though the game was released after Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari and uses similar graphics, they game doesn\u0027t give the player an option to choose between Kunio or Riki (the first player always controls Kunio and he is the only playable character in a single player game, only the second player can use Riki, though both characters play the same).",
    "summary": "Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-kun: Bangai Rantou Hen is the first game in the Kunio-kun series released by Technōs Japan for the Game Boy. It is a sequel to Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-kun, but uses the graphical style of Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari, which was previously released on the Famicom. This is the second game in the Kunio-kun series that has Kunio and Riki joining forces against a common threat, which would become a standard in later games. The game was released on western markets by Acclaim as Double Dragon II (Technōs originally planned to publish the game themselves, which they were planning to name The Renegades). The game was released for the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console on August 8, 2012 in Japan.",

    "summary": "When humankind discovers an alien race on a distant planet, it becomes clear that the extra-terrestrial way of life threatens survival on Earth. Rather than sending out a fleet of space destroyers or loads of nuclear warheads, it is determined that Earth\u0027s best chance of wiping out these creatures is (drum roll, please) you! As Space Marauder, it is your job to avoid waves of space beings careening through the outer reaches of the galaxy. You are aiding only by a jet pack and a laser gun. Sound tough? It is. Assorted power-ups are strewn about to help you in your plight, but the best asset you\u0027ll have is your itchy trigger finger and taste for alien blood. Lots of powerful bosses wait at the end of each of the game\u0027s levels, and every stage presents new and increasingly difficult challenges for our hero. Boasting a cool soundtrack and smooth controls, there\u0027s plenty of gameplay to keep your fingers moving for hours on end.",

In this massively addictive game developed exclusively for the Game Boy Color, it\u0027s up to you to gain as many points as you can while the clock ticks down. Here\u0027s how it works: different colored balls are attached to moving gears; you rotate the gears in an attempt to get four balls of the same color aligned (in a 2x2 square grid at the bottom of the screen), which blows them to smithereens. This clears the stage and advances you to the next level. There\u0027s no time to rest though, as each successive round of sphere-blasting fun is more difficult than the last. You\u0027ll listen to five original songs in the challenging, pop-and-bop gameplay that confronts you on more than 100 fast-moving levels. If you couldn\u0027t get enough of TETRIS or BUST-A-MOVE, then you\u0027ll love TROUBALLS to pieces.",

The only thing that stands between the peaceful races of Strife and the threat of deadly invasion is a Rune of Darkstone, the only key that can open the portal to the underworld of Sheol. For generations this mystical item, a fragment of the ancient Dark Obelisk, has been kept by the Keepers of the Code, the sacred guardians of the Planes of Strife. But the cryptic rune has gone missing. And some fear the worst. \n \nIn preparation of a Dharkwave invasion, the Keepers of the Code have built an Arena in Strife, with the hope that the fabled Army of Light might be trained there. Some even say the Golden Child of prophecy has appeared at the arena, riding his mystical Zidek dragon. \n \nNow, the mightiest heroes from the 5 planes are gathering together to face this new dread. They have come to Strife from their home Planes of Gael, Vorbis, Nestra, Tempra and Lyrie to battle in the arena, to prove their worth and to represent their people in the coming battle. Some will rise. Some will fall. And all will be pushed to the limits of their strength and courage.",
    "summary": "Strife pits two teams of players against each other, both teams are based at opposite corners of the map in their respective bases. Bases consist of one central structure, creep spawn points, three generators and a hero spawning pool. The goal of the game is to destroy the central structure of the opposite base. \n \nPlayers achieve this by selecting heroes with unique skills to combat the other team, both teams can select the same heroes. Each game, a player chooses one hero to be for the duration of the match. Every hero has four abilities that may be acquired and upgraded as the hero gains experience and levels up.",

Zangetsu must battle his way to the demonic stronghold, but he doesn\u0027t have to do it alone! Zangetsu can ally himself with a brand new cast of characters he meets along the way and add them to the playable roster. \n \nThree brand-new playable characters appear in Curse of the Moon 2, including the exorcist Dominique. All characters from the original Curse of the Moon game are playable, too! Each new character adds a variety of gameplay options, abilities, and ways to complete the games\u0027 many stages. \n \nPlayers can also create demon hunting duos in 2-player local co-op, available for the first time in the series! Work together with a friend, mix and match the strengths of two different characters, and conquer stages in tons of new and exciting ways.",

The walls and carpet are uncomfortably plain, the camera in the corner not helping with that discomfort. After a few moments, the unbearable silence is finally broken by the ringing of the rotary phone. There\u0027s nothing left for you to do but answer the call. \n \nSummerland is a first-person narrative game developed by high school student Conner Rush.

Collect chunks of metal to grow yourself, leap into the water for an explosive jump, or barely graze past a whirring saw with just a sliver of body remaining. Coupling traditional platformer mechanics with these new interactions, Alkali brings a novel twist on a classical genre.\n\nThe game also contains a fully fledged level editor, where anyone can get creative and make interesting and fun levels for others to play. Using the same tools that were used to create the Alkali\u0027s campaign, you can explore fun gimmicks or create difficult masterpieces as you wish.",

    "summary": "Sensible Soccer: European Champions is a fast-paced soccer game. The action is shown from a top-down perspective which only shows a part of the playfield. The controls only use one button to initiate a shot: how long the button is pressed determines the strength and the direction pad controls the direction. However, there is also a novice mode available with the usual division between a shoot and pass button. Another important option is the dribbling (novice or expert) which sets how well the ball sticks to the controlled athlete. Before starting a match, there are also some limited tactical options available (choosing the formation and switching the position of athletes around).\n\nIn contrast to the computer versions there are no pre-set tournaments, but the player can start two tournaments with customizable requirements: cup or league. The cup allows to set the number of rounds (one to four) and some rules can be switched on or off for each round individually (number of legs, extra time, penalties). The league on the other hand has the options number of teams (between one and seven), how often the teams face each other (between once and four times) and if a win rewards two or three points. The pitch type (normal, dry, wet, icy, hard or random) can be set in both modes. There are twenty national and twenty club teams (all with slightly changed original names) to choose from. General options are the game length (between three and seven minutes) as well as switching weather on or off.",

    "summary": "Plot \n \nWith the Snowball 9 orbiting Eden, the surviving crew members put Kim on trial. The only evidence against her is the \"mempak\" from the control room, which shows her as the hijacker rather than the saviour. Despite the fact that the recording is damaged and thus is unreliable, they sentence her to death. About to be thrown into space, Kim manages to escape aboard a \"stratoglider\" and an hour later, lands on Eden. At this point the game starts. \n \nThe first thing the player must do is find a shelter for Kim, because a few moves into the game the Snowball 9 crew use the ship\u0027s engine to try to burn her down. The native robots take this as proof that the Snowball 9 is not the ship they were expecting but a hostile alien craft they must destroy. The objective is to contact the robots before time ends for the Snowball 9 and everyone aboard it. \n \nDevelopment \n \nUnlike its predecessor, Return to Eden only had about two hundred and fifty locations, but it was Level 9\u0027s first game to feature graphics.[5] Other adventure games had included graphics before, but version 2 of the A-Code system, allowed Level 9 to encode location graphics into as little as forty bytes. This size made it possible to add graphics to every location of the game for all formats with more than 32 K RAM. The user could choose not to display them and play the game in text-only mode. It was released for the same platforms as its predecessor. \n \nThe game\u0027s first cover depicted a robot fighting a monster plant in Enoch. The robot resembled a comic book character, so to avoid legal troubles, Level 9 commissioned Godfrey Dowson to do a new cover. Dowson\u0027s illustration depicted another robot in the jungle looking towards Enoch. Level 9 was not satisfied with the result and asked Dowson to do it again. They liked the third cover so much, they hired Dowson to do artwork for the re-release of their old games as well as for their future titles. \n \nPete Austin commented on the game: \"It\u0027s an alien theme park gone wild. The Eden universe is more like Larry Niven\u0027s future space.\" and \"...is intended as a comment on superpower intervention in the Third World.\"",

However, peace is threatened by the invading armies of the Jyn Empire, led by Emperor Grym, who wants to use the four crystals to rule over Tyramus. Fortunately, Princess Iris can escape with one of the crystals and now the player has to protect her and the crystal and somehow find a way to drive back the hordes of Jyn. \n \nGameplay in Crystal Warriors is quite similar to Shining Force. The player fights in turn-based battles controlling different characters like fighters, healers, rangers and mages, all with different strengths and skills. Whenever two units engage in battle, they enter a duel mode lasting for up to two turns. In this mode the player can choose between four commands: \"battle\" (attack), \"retreat\", \"spell\" and \"monster\". While the first three commands are quite self-explanatory, the \"monster\" command is interesting. Whenever a non-human enemy is defeated, it can be tamed and be used in battles. While most monsters do not have many HP they can serve as good attackers for physically weak characters or take some hits in order to protect his master. In-between battles the player can visit towns to rest, buy weapons and spells or recruit new party members.",

    "summary": "A mystical force known as Gaia permeates every aspect of the planet. Those who are aware of the force can manipulate it to do their bidding. While most use Gaia for good, there are those who would use it for evil. You take the role of El, who must journey around the world in hopes of stopping those who want to use Gaia for evil. Along the way, you will encounter new friends that will aid you in the quest. Ultimately, you will encounter monsters, and if you\u0027re lucky, you\u0027ll be able to convince the monsters to join you. When a monster has joined the party, it can be summoned to help in battle. While the monster will not gain experience, it can be combined with other creatures to create a more powerful monster. Try to keep Gaia pure and evil free in REVELATIONS: The Demon Slayer.",

Choose whether you want to play three, five, or seven-minute halves, and decide whether you want your overtime decisions to be made Golden Goal or Extended Time-style. The gameplay and decisions are so detailed, you can even select your starting lineup and reserve players, pick a formation, and set up your own strategies. You can engage in any number of exhibition games (alone or against a friend), but the real fun begins in International Cup mode, in which you claw your way up from a ranking of 32nd in the world. Beginners and seasoned veterans alike will get plenty of mileage out of the game, as there are three different difficulty settings to master.",
