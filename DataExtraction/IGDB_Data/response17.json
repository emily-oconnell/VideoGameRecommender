It can be a small database of games, a downloadable art show, a simulation, a moving painting, an album, an existential crisis, a talisman, a play, a meditation, a spell, a forest, a distopian nightmare, a joke.\n\nThe amount of interaction and exploration is not a ton. If you explore and play through everything it would take maybe an hour or so at most.\n-There are small games and walking sims to play on machines in abandoned buildings.\n-You can chat with other players in the multiplayer mode and see if they are human or machine\n-There is a band and a small secret lair\n-There is no beginning or end\n-There is no winning or losing\n\nAnd there is an infinite, dramatic cycle of accumulation and destruction:\n\nHit the number 3 key. You can choose the perspective of 3 NPC actors or a stage overview. They are acting out an absurdist play. They are the sole survivors of a human apocalypse. They are trying to procreate to start civilization over again but they’re having a hard time. They are sending emails to nowhere, gossiping, meditating, taking naps, cleaning up. They’re collecting artifacts around the stage and building a machine. When the machine is done it generates an AI and then blows up.\n\nTo see what the NPCs do you can leave the simulation on at a party, in a room while you are doing other things, etc. It could run for many hours and you will see, read and hear different things.\nIf you have a few computers you can link them up and see different perspectives at once. With multiple channels of the atmospheric sounds it becomes a sort of instrument or generative album as well.",

    "summary": "Accompany Leona in a clever puzzle adventure to save the inhabitants of a strange but lovely world. Featuring fresh puzzle mechanics, wonderful retro graphics, lots of exploration and an excellent soundtrack by legendary game composer Chris Huelsbeck.\n\nLeona’s Tricky Adventures is inspired by a clever puzzle game mechanic which was briefly explored in the very early 90s but sadly faded from prominence shortly after. The basic task is to match two increasingly complex patterns using increasingly complex mechanics. While it can’t be directly compared to any contemporary game the mental skills required by the puzzles put them somewhere in between \"Picross\" and \"Bejeweled\" – and in our humble opinion they can easily stand up against those games.\n\nAll puzzles are embedded in a big and complex overworld full of exploration and humorous citizens constructed entirely using beautifully hand-drawn pixel graphics. Exploration and puzzle-solving is intertwined in clever and varied ways which draw you deeper into the game world.",

They find a treasure map which is supposed to lead to the hideout of \"One-eyed Willie\", a pirate.\n\nMikey can convince his friends to go for a treasure hunt. This starts in an abandoned restaurant. The evil Fratellis have settled in there. So after all Goonies, except for Chunk who is supposed to call the police, have entered a system of catacombs through a manhole in the restaurant, the adventure really begins. So the kids do not only have to beware of mean traps and bats, but also of Mama Fratelli.",

Starting out with a small village, one of your goals is to build it up into a strong castle, fortified by impregnable city walls. But Tribal Wars 2 is so much more than just a simple strategy city building game – you also have to assemble an army by recruiting and training soldiers, such as axemen or spear fighters. With them, you are able to defend and expand your kingdom in the free-to-play medieval strategy game. \n \nBased on the classic Tribal Wars, the brand new browser game delights with striking graphic and interface improvements. In addition to that, Tribal Wars 2 features a strategic map, where different areas give you distinct boosts in resource production. You can also follow your army movements on the map in real-time. No matter if you are just getting to know Tribal Wars 2 or if you are a veteran of good old Tribal Wars, you will surely have a fresh and unique strategy game experience! \n \nSometimes, rallying your troops may not be enough to succeed in PvP battles in a strategy game like Tribal Wars 2. Then it is time to form alliances with other players. With the help of so-called tribes your chances to dominate your opponents increase. Will you bring your adversaries to their knees and rise to power?",

When everyone is invisible, players will have to master the art of taking a not-so sneaky look at their opponent’s screens and working out where they are based on uniquely coloured areas of the map and distinctive landmarks.\n\nScreencheat pays homage to iconic competitive first-person shooters such as Goldeneye, Perfect Dark and Halo, by blending the elements everyone loves about those games and shaking it up with its own unique take on the genre. When everyone’s used to playing by the rules, can you adapt to unconventional gaming quick enough to get the upper hand?",

Can she manage to find the missing girl before another tragedy takes place?\n\n…And will she be able to sleuth out her own memories and the meaning behind their disappearance at the same time?",

There is a current generator on each of the boards, linked to the fan through a path. Problem is, the path is broken in several places! To ensure that the current reaches the fan uninterrupted, you must create an electric arc wherever the circuit was damaged. Seems complicated? Don\u0027t worry. No electrical know-how is required! You just need to skillfully operate a metal ball and build electric arcs with it where needed. It\u0027s quite simple and intuitive. Bear in mind that with each board comes with new challenges. Always start by planning your next move, then carefully execute it.",

The people of Mizuho were peaceful, didn\u0027t seek to cause conflicts, honored their ancestral spirits, and lived in harmony with nature. \n \nBut, as they developed cultivation technology, the people started relying on metal more and more, began having disputes, destroyed nature, and neglected their ancestral spirits. \n \nIn the midst of all this, natural disasters, such as floods, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions, started happening all over Mizuho. \n \nIn order to prevent the destruction of the world, the Queen of the Fuji Nation, Tsukuyomi, sacrificed her beloved daughter, Sakuya, to the volcanic crater of Mount Fuji, and confined Sakuya\u0027s younger sister, Kaguya, within a bamboo seal to be a backup sacrifice. Then, Tsukuyomi disappeared. \n \n13 years later, Princess Kaguya has grown into a beautiful woman and escapes during a riot with the help of her childhood friend, Kintaro. \n \nKaguya resists her fate to be a sacrifice, and sets off on a journey across the land of Mizuho in order to discover the truth behind her mother\u0027s actions.\"",

Released December 9, 1989, the game features play for both one- and two-player modes. It was released a year later in the United States as WCW Wrestling on the Nintendo Entertainment System, with different wrestlers.\n\nThe game featured several puroresu legends of the era, including Giant Baba, Antonio Inoki, and Stan Hansen. There are some inaccuracies in the game, mainly with the birthdates of some of the wrestlers, and Big Van Vader\u0027s hometown and date of birth are not listed in order to protect his gimmick. The only two wrestlers to appear in both Super Star Pro Wrestling and WCW Wrestling are Road Warrior Hawk and Road Warrior Animal.",

The game is a role-playing game based on the works of Japanese author, Kenji Miyazawa, and its release was intended to commemorate the 100-year anniversary of his birth. The game is a sequel to the 1993 Hecht game for the SNES, Ihatovo Monogatari, earlier-broadcast for the Satellaview as well. Intended as a family-oriented game for all ages, the game makes reference to many classic works of Japanese children\u0027s literature.\n\nBS Ihatovo Monogatari incorporates voice narration at the start of each weekly broadcast to provide dramatic performances of Miyazawa\u0027s poetry set in Ihatovo. During gameplay, the Soundlink provides sound effects and gameplay hints for players. The game\u0027s voice actors were selected by popular vote by readers of Seiyu Zasshi and included Kikuko Inoue, Kouichi Yamadera, Yuka Imai, and Eiichi Onoda.",

The party once again attempts to save a town under siege (once re-equipped) and struggles to learn the secret of the Silver Blades... \n \nThe gameplay is quite similar to that of the previous Gold Box games. Following the AD\u0026D rules of role-playing, the player creates a party of characters (up to the maximum of six). Exploration takes place in pseudo-3D environments, from first-person view. Battles (random as well as pre-set) take the player-controlled and enemy party to a top-down battle screen. Commands are issued in turn-based fashion, and the player-controlled characters can freely navigate the battle field. Unlike the previous games, there is no \"world map\" traveling in Secret of the Silver Blades. All the exploration takes place in the 3D world.",

You can play against the computer of challenge a friend. Your capabilities -- and your opponent\u0027s -- will be just like those of All-Stars Larry Bird and Julius (Dr. J) Erving. The computer knows their shooting percentages (guarded and unguarded) and their pet shots. Your scoring ability will depend on your timing, how effectively you\u0027re being guarded, and where you\u0027re shooting from. Like the game of basketball itself, One-on-One rewards you for playing with your head as well as your hands. Master the joystick moves, sharpen your timing, hone your reflexes until you can handle the Pro level... and don\u0027t let the other guy out-think you.",

    "summary": "bit Generations: Dialhex is a Game Boy Advance video game released in 2006 by Nintendo and skip, Ltd. The game was part of the initial batch of bit Generations games. The game was not released in America or Europe, but a remake of the game, titled Art Style: ROTOHEX for the Wii\u0027s WiiWare service, was released two years later in 2008. The remake was slightly different, though was instantly recognizable to fans of Dialhex. \n \nGameplay \nIn Dialhex, you turn differently colored triangles on a playing field. The goal of the game is to turn them in a way so that you create a hexagon that contains triangles of the same color. After doing so, you\u0027ll be rewarded a set amount of points and the triangles within the hexagon will disappear, with the triangles in the surrounding areas taking their place. The board itself is in the shape of a hexagon, and triangles will continually fall down from the top. Once they hit another triangle, they\u0027ll stop moving, waiting for the player to make use of them. If the player has destroyed most of the triangles on the stage, and the amount of triangles is a bare minimum, then they can press the L and R button, or the A and B button, at the same time to cause the triangles that drop to come down faster. The triangles will also start to drop faster as the player progresses through the game. \n \nOnce you start a new game, you\u0027ll be given just two colors (in the start, green and orange). After six hexagons have been created, then another color will be added to the mix, and will start to drop down from above. In all, the colors, including the ones mentioned, are green, orange, yellow, red, blue, purple, cyan, and a darker green. \n \nAfter you\u0027ve reached a certain point in the game\u0027s main mode, you\u0027ll be given access to the title\u0027s endless mode. In endless mode, you\u0027ll keep on going for as long as you possibly can, trying to rank up as many points as possible. The game starts similarly to the title\u0027s main mode, and new colors will start to drop just as they did in that mode too. The only difference is that it never ends until the player gets a gameover. In order to unlock the staff credits, you just need to create six cyan hexagons in the game\u0027s main mode. After doing this the credits will be available on the game\u0027s main screen.",

    "summary": "Tropix! is a unique blend of eleven different games, all set within a sunny island paradise. The game combines many classic gameplay ideas in one title, delivering a large amount of variety and keeps the game experience fresh.\n\nThe eleven games are all linked to a central theme - collecting sand dollars to enable you to travel to new islands, buy toys and food for your Tamagotchi-style monkey, and unlock even more games to play.\n\nEach mini game offers the player a different gameplay experience. These are some of them:\n\nPuffer Popper\nWith help from Crab the player must defend the sand castle by destroying bubbles as they snake towards the beach.\n\nA classic and instantly playable concept, Puffer Popper requires the player to connect three bubbles of the same colour to win. Use the left and right joystick or directional pad to aim the beam, and press the action button to fire a bubble.\n\nThe game can be increased in difficulty through the addition of multiple Puffer fish and by potentially removing the players aiming beam.\n\nJungle Jump\nJungle jump is a game of timing and skill. Use the left and right buttons on the joystick or directional pad to guide the Monkey through increasingly difficult jungle levels.\n\nShell Game\nThe shell game is both a game of skill and observation coupled with a way to win more Sand Dollars. Conceptually the Shell Game is extremely simple: three shells that swap, the user must pick the shell that hides the pearl.\n\nDue to the high expense of certain shop items and the cost of purchasing new islands, the user can use the Shell Game to win the Sand Dollars required to make these large purchases.\n\nSandoku\nThe classic favorite Sudoku makes the transition to Tropix effectively, with intuitive play.\n\nCascade\nCascade is a casual concept. The game is a variation on the classic objective of connecting three of a kind. This type of game can be controlled exclusively via the joystick or directional pad with the addition of the action button to make selections.\n\nThe overall design is about linking these mini-games into a \"world\" where you buy things, look after a creature, travel around and explore. For casual gamers, Tropix is simple to play, and can be played in short bites or in long sessions.",

    "summary": "This game is not what it seems... \n \nInspired by creepy/bad edutainment games from the 90s, Baldi\u0027s Basics is a meta horror game that\u0027s really weird, with no real educational value to be found. The goal of the game is to collect seven notebooks, and then escape the school, but that\u0027s easier said than done! You\u0027ll need to learn all the ins-and-outs of the game to come up with a winning strategy and avoid being caught by Baldi. Learning how to use Baldi\u0027s friends to your advantage, wisely managing the items found throughout the school, and memorizing the layout of Baldi\u0027s school are all keys to success!",

The virtual reality simulator, in the context of the game\u0027s fictional world, recreates Ace\u0027s famous historical battle against the Sinlendo Techmods from the parallel dimension of Ceeg that invaded his home universe to recover bomb components in the installations of the Ceegraian Power Station that were necessary to defeat alien race.",
    "summary": "Power Factor is a 1993 side-scrolling action-platform video game developed by Hand Made Software and published by Atari Corporation in North America and Europe exclusively for the Atari Lynx. Based around a video game within a video game concept, players take control of a character who is in turn playing on a virtual reality simulator assuming the role of Redd Ace, which is recreating his battle against the Sinlendo Techmods by recovering necessary bomb components to defeat the alien race at the Ceegraian Power Station. Its gameplay consists of platforming, exploration and weapons-based combat with a main four-button configuration.\n\nPower Factor originally began as a project intended for the Atari ST that was in development by Red Rat Software under the title Red Ace, which was nearly completed before being left unpublished due to internal issues at the company and its eventual disbandment prior to release, however Hand Made Software would later develop a conversion to the Lynx.\n\nPower Factor has been met with positive reception from critics and reviewers since its initial release, who praised various aspects of the title such as the unique storyline, graphics and character animation but many felt divided in regards to the sound design and gameplay. In 2005, a ROM image of the original ST version was leaked online.",

The gameplay is similar to that of other contemporary racing games, with a two-speed shifter and a chase view. A key difference from other arcade racing games at the time is that the roads have 90-degree turns.[3] It includes sights such as the famous trams and the Golden Gate Bridge. The player can pick from two police cars, one designed for power resembling the Cadillac Brougham, and another designed for handling resembling the Nissan 300ZX Z32.",

Rising from this new dark age are powerful diseases and illnesses, reminiscent of the plagues from times long passed. The probability of becoming infected by a serious illness has sharply increased, while at the same time traditional medical techniques have become less effective.\n\nIn the face of such an onslaught, large-scale pharmaceutical companies have begun to invest large amounts of money and manpower into the study and development of nano-machine technology. From this medicinal arms race the NCR (Nano Core Robot) was born – a new and highly effective weapon in the war against sickness. But is this truly the savior we have been calling for, or is there something more lurking beneath the surface?\n\nBacterium puts players behind the controls of an NCR nano-machine. In the name of the global pharmaceutical corporation you work for, become a frontline soldier in the war against the viruses",

Every round has 5 difficulties; starting with “baby” difficulty all the way to “nightmare”. The amount of points earned for each successful guess depends on the selected activity – describing, drawing, or pantomime. \n \nFor example, describing is the easiest one, so for each successful guess you will get only one point. However, in the case of pantomime you get three points per word. Each round, you can pick which activity to do. You can decide to play it safe and choose to describe all the time, though if your opponents ace the harder activities, they will most likely beat you. \n \nYou can keep up with your current standing by checking team scores depicted as cute progress bars with each team’s color at the bottom of the screen. They show which team is closer to earning fifty points and winning the game. To see who is the reigning Partivity champion among your friends, you can check out the previous games section for the history of all played games along with each game’s winner. If you are up to the task of snatching their champion title, just tap the rematch button and the game is on. \n \nFeatures \nPlay in two to six teams with as many people as you like. \nPause the game just by closing the app and continue whenever you feel like it. \nRecreate teams from previous games to beat the last winner. Increasing difficulty with each successful guess. \nTeam scores visible at a glance with cute progress bars. \n6 supported languages: English, Spanish, Chinese (simplified), Japanese, Czech and Slovak.",
