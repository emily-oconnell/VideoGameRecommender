    "storyline": "Vantage is a game where you play a prehistoric cave person and the objective is simple... to survive! You search a massive persistent open world in search of food, drink, and shelter.\nThe game has a realistic, complex, yet intuitive crafting and skill system. Crafting in Vantage is heavily researched to be as realistically accurate as possible. For example: to create a primitive fire you must first create a wooden spindle and hearth, as well as find some tinder (dry grass for example). Then with these items you attempt to create a fire using the \"hand drill\" method. Crafting uses time and energy, as well as many skills which make your crafting easier. If your crafting skills are to low then you may fail at your professions until you work to get better at them.\nYou can brave the large world alone, or with friends online! Create your own village, or even an entire town with your friends. You can also gather your friends to go hunting for animals. You can go spear-fishing, take out rabbits with your sling, or go for bigger prey like Sabertooth Tigers. And if you are up to the challenge, you can get a group of friends together into a hunting party and you can try your hand at hunting mammoths! Be careful though, the bigger the animals, the more dangerous they are!",

For the hellspawns the human weapons was not much of a threat, just like peashooter versus elephant. It looked like the human race has no hope left for survival. But in the darkest hour the glimpse of hope, the ray of light appeared, and so it happened: the group of american scientists with Dr. Gusev as their lead scientist invented the special photon cannons, that can easily tear demon flesh apart. New photon weapons were installed on advanced tank models, created by Greenrunner Industries corporation. But there was a problem with tanks — they can be operated only by those who created it. These people were genius engineers of their time, but when they opposed the government they were imprisoned as war criminals. But facing the total destruction of all life on Earth the government decided to make a compromise. Now there is only one way for Travis Greenrunner and his people to get their freedom back — to drive away the demon scum to the place they crawled out from!",

    "storyline": "Sam is the Systems Architect to the Icebox, a digital device designed to subvert the conscious mind. But he always feared the technology may fall into the wrong hands. So he planted covert programs as insurance against any personal incarceration.\n\nOn the eve of final testing, the Blacksuits ambushed Sam’s office, stole his invention and kidnapped his only son. They wired the child’s brain to the Icebox in an attempt to decrypt the system. But their attempts failed and the child was soon forgotten, resigned to a protracted hibernation.\n\nAfter years of inactivity, the Icebox was suddenly restarted…\n\nYou play as Sam’s son. Your DNA has triggered an automatic failsafe. You must now search and destroy the Central AI to escape the Icebox before the Blacksuits can take ultimate control.",

    "summary": "Metal Dungeon (メタルダンジョン?) is a turn-based role-playing video game developed by Panther Software for Microsoft\u0027s Xbox game system. \n \nThe game takes place in a fictional alternate reality where countries have access to highly advanced magitechnology. In the process of creating monsters with this technology using an ancient creature named \"The Gods of Magic\"; it broke free of its bonds and took control of the secret facility and proceeded to slay all of the research team and arm the compounds defenses. The player is a commander in charge of the Cyborg Enforcer Teams sent into the dungeon to reclaim it. The game featured 100 levels of randomly generated maps, the first ten being the games main story mode. The other 90 were extended play for players wanting to continue playing with their strong characters. \n \nGame play[edit] \nAs the game starts, you create a team of Enforcers for your expeditions into the dungeon, with the option to create over 40 total. When creating your characters you are given the ability to alter height, sex, ethnicity, weight and hair style as well as given a choice between the Fencer, Caster, Analyzer, Striker, or Broader classes; Each falling into a Dungeons and Dragons styled role. Several Advanced classes were available by finding Class Chips in the dungeon and applying them to your characters. Once inside the dungeon, the players team must move around, find monsters and equipment while leveling up. A major point unsaid in game is that you are not expected to be able to beat a level\u0027s boss on the first time entering the level; as you could only allocate level up points while out of the dungeon. \n \nDungeons were randomly generated, most adhering to a typical design that made the map seem less random then it was. Each level has a control room that could possibly be locked, holding a boss monster that must be defeated to win the level and unlock the next one. \n \nFencer Fighter class that could use Hammers or Swords and had the rare chance of performing a move like a Final Fantasy \"Limit Break\" that would damage all enemies at once. \n \nAnalyzer Ranged class. Without an Analyzer in the party, the player is unable to know how much health enemies have and their current HP amount. Analyzers used firearms ranging from laser beams, to machine guns, to rocket launchers that all shared the same in game model. \n \nCaster Basic Spell Caster that could be wired with a variety of Spell Chips either bought from the in-game shop or found in the dungeon. Each spell had a number of charges that had to be refilled by visiting the surface. Casters automatically blocked until the player told them what spell to use. \n \nBroader The Jack-Of-All-Trades class that had a flat rate for all skill gains at the expense of leveling up extremely slowly and was reserved for advanced players that foresaw spending a large time grinding. \n \nStriker A barbarian class that used combat gloves as their weapon. Each strike had a rare chance of instantly killing a non-boss enemy. \n \nReception[edit] \nMetal Dungeon was rated very poorly for its simple game play, transparent story, and character creation system. The game\u0027s setting turned it into a cult classic near instantly for its magic-punk stylized world. The only two male African American skins available looked exactly like",

Swing through a dark lab. Die, a lot. The trials before you won\u0027t be easy. So, let\u0027s see what you got. \n \nThe game is designed to challenge the player in such a way where they adapt their own style and platforming skills; no two players will play through each zone the same way. With a limitless combination of movement options and paths through a zone, there will always be a way to clear a zone faster. Compete with your friends and the world as you climb from just barely scraping through each zone in the first play through to smashing each zone in under thirty seconds. \n \nMovement is very expressive. As a player gains more experience and unlocks new abilities, they\u0027ll create their own style. One player might prefer running up a wall, while another would swing around it, while another would jump up it. \n \nThere\u0027s also much more to do besides clearing zones with a surprise waiting for any player skilled enough to complete a play through.",

Released on March 18, 2003, the Rainbow Six video game series is based on Tom Clancy\u0027s best-selling novel of the same name. \n \nBased on the Unreal Engine 2.0, Raven Shield is a tactical shooter with realistic properties. Raven Shield moved toward mainstream first-person shooters like Counter-Strike, adapting various features absent in previous versions. These included the ability to see one\u0027s weapon while in first-person view, many new weapons and upgrades (including larger magazines and sights), and a redesigned multiplayer. \n \nA console version, entitled Rainbow Six 3, was developed for the Xbox, PlayStation 2, and Nintendo GameCube. This iteration of the game features the same basic engine, models, textures, and artwork, but with significantly different game mechanics, gameplay, and storyline. A port was also released on Mac OS X on December 19, 2003. Due to the console version\u0027s success on the Xbox and the popularity of its subscription-based online multiplayer service, Xbox Live, an Xbox-exclusive semi-sequel was released in 2004 titled Rainbow Six 3: Black Arrow. The next full game in the Rainbow Six series, Rainbow Six: Lockdown, was released in 2005.",

There are also a number of dimensional stages, in the Dreamworld. Tak gets aid from animals, a number of which did not appear in the first game. In this game, Tak\u0027s juju magic is triggered by holding down one button and pressing combos of other buttons. Tak also earns juju powers gradually throughout the game instead of having to seek them out.",

As you hunt for your lost little brother, Delbert, you must enter a house full of zombies, spooks, and bad guys and turn them into hamburger meat, before they make a meal out of you in Dangerous Dave in the Haunted Mansion! \n \nDangerous Dave’s Risky Rescue \nUnfortunately for our hero, his little brother is afflicted with “always getting kidnapped” syndrome. Dangerous Dave must battle wolves, mummies, ghosts, and other ghastly apparitions on his way to save Delbert from the clutches of the evil Dr. Nemesis. With 11 levels of spine-tingling platforming action, you’ll be shooting up a storm in Dangerous Dave’s Risky Rescue! \n \nDave Goez Nutz! \nLife is difficult enough without having Dr. Nemesis as your arch-villain. Why does he have to pick on Dave’s little brother, Delbert, so much? Not only does he snatch the already kidnapping-prone Delbert, but he hides him away deep in the bowel of an insane asylum! Crazy nurses wearing purple of all colors wander the halls, cleaver wielding orderlies, and jolts of electricity all stand in Dangerous Dave’s way in Dave Goez Nutz! \nThe Dangerous Dave Pack includes Dangerous Dave in the Haunted Mansion, Dangerous Dave’s Risky Rescue, Dave Goez Nutz! and The Deserted Pirate\u0027s Hangout! \nA wide variety of locations ranging from a haunted house to the insanity of a mental hospital! \nOver 30 levels combined of side-scrolling, platforming-and-gunning action!",

Fires burn brightly throughout the galaxies, illuminating carnage and slaughter as mankind defends itself from ancient enemies. Hardened forces collide with one goal in mind, the complete extermination of their opposition. Control one of four unique races in head-to-head or cooperative multiplayer action, where faith, skill, and strategy are requisites in ruling the universes. \n \nWinter Assault: \nThe expansion pack to the award winning Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War will build upon the most exciting, visceral, front-line battlefield ever seen in an RTS game. Lost amongst the ruins of a leveled city lies an Emperor Class Titan, a war vessel of untold power forged in the planet-wide furnaces of Mars, and revered by billions as the epitome of Imperial dominance. The one who controls it will command the power to destroy, or defend, a world. The Imperials will summon it to overcome great evil, Chaos will corrupt it for their own designs, Orks will destroy it in their bloodlust and Eldar will disregard it in their arrogance. \n \nDark Crusade: \nWarhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Dark Crusade will feature two new playable races, the Tau Empire and the Necrons, bringing the number of totally unique races to an unprecedented seven. In addition to the two new playable races, Dark Crusade will feature an all-new single player campaign centering on the conquest of a \"meta-map,\" with each territory captured giving tangible rewards to the occupying force. A greatly expanded multiplayer component and a completely unique economy model for the Necrons will present gamers with the most compelling Dawn of War game to-date.",

    "storyline": "The main character must complete quests and slay wild animals and monsters to earn skill points, which are used to increase basic attributes, improve skills, and learn trades. They are spent by finding the appropriate teacher. Several skills have only one \"level\" (Sneaking, Acrobatics), while the fighting skills (one-handed weapons, two-handed weapons, bows and crossbows) have two proficiency levels. If the Hero chooses to be a Mage (or joins the Swamp Camp), he will be able to learn Circles of Magic; of which there are 6. The main attributes are increased in 1 or 5 point increments, starting at 10 and capping off at 100. The cap can be surpassed with the use of potions.\n\nThe game places a special focus on the interactivity of the environment. For example, hunting wild animals can earn the player raw meat. This heals damage and can be sold. However, by using a stove or frying pan, the player may also choose to turn this into grilled meat, which heals much more effectively. Similarly, most of the activities other characters can be seen doing (playing musical instruments, stirring soup pots, urinating etc.) can be done by the main character as well (although with the exception of forging weapons these activities have little bearing on the game).\n\nThe player can choose which camp to join, although quests get increasingly linear and the distinctions between different factions wane in the latter parts of the game. The major difference is that Swamp Camp members cannot become mages, because they are limited to 4 magic circles (out of 6). However, they gain access to magic earlier.",
    "summary": "Gothic is a single-player action role-playing video game for Windows developed by the German company Piranha Bytes. It was first released in Germany on March 15, 2001, followed by the English North American release eight months later on November 23, 2001, and the Polish release on March 28, 2002.\n\nGothic has been well received by critics, scoring an average of 80% and 81/100 on Game Rankings\u0027 and Metacritic\u0027s aggregates, respectively. Reviewers credited the game for its story, complex interaction with other in-game characters, and graphics, but criticized it for the difficult control scheme and high system requirements.",

It was released in Japan on August 26, 2010. The word airou (アイルー airū) is the Japanese equivalent of felyne, a fictional sapient cat species that appears in all of the Monster Hunter games. The player gives orders to the felynes to progress to the end of quests instead of having direct control over them. The game also uses a much more cartoonish art style as opposed to the realism seen in other Monster Hunter games. More emphasis is placed on style and village management. A few Hello Kitty items are also available in the game. \n \nMonster Hunter Diary Poka Poka Airou Village G is an expansion pack and was released on August 10, 2011 in Japan. \n \nMonster Hunter Diary Giri Giri Airou Village is a series of ten television shorts developed to help advertise Poka Poka Airou Village. They feature felynes attempting quests and almost invariably failing at them. One episode also has a Chibiterasu cameo. \n \nA Nintendo 3DS version of the game, titled Monster Hunter Diary: Poka Poka Airou Village DX was developed and released in Japan on September 10, 2015",

Communication will be your best friend, remember you play as a team.\n\nTwo teams are facing each other, the « defenders » and the « attackers ».\nThe defenders must complete missions all game long, if they manage to accomplish them, they’ll win.\nThe attackers must attempt to escape by finding solutions, while doing tasks that the defenders will require them to do.\n\nThe lobby system allows you to create private or public games, in order to play, as you wish, only with your friends or other players from the Octofight community.\nThanks to the in-game mic system, you can as well coordinate and chat verbally with your friends and as well as with other players.\nUpdates are common for the delight of players, in order to add content such as characters, cosmetics, maps, and other ways of playing...\n\nTime is running out, don’t waste it, run aways or catch them all!",

With a freshly made trainer license, you are preparing to challenge the local Pokemon league and hopefully have an unforgettable and fun time with your friends. Unfortunately, a gang war between two mysterious groups erupts and you are separated from your friends and thrown into an island with an unfriendly passenger named Connor who does not hide his contempt for you at all but is willing to work with you. Scrounging up a stray Pokeball from the wreckage of the boat and on the run from the unfriendly natives who worship a man named Kuiki, you and Connor seek to find your friends and survive. Unfortunately things get even more complicated when you are entangled with the machinations of a man calling himself Shiv who knows you for some reason, and the idealistic Utopian dreams of a woman called Nova. Both with strange powers that defy reality and both wanting your support. How will you make your way in this island of mystery and deception? Things may not be all they seem...",

They set out on adventures through the world\u0027s past and learn about its history. Upon discovering different lands in the past and solving the troubles, they reappear in the game\u0027s present-day map.\n\nThe party begins their adventure when the hero and Kiefer discover a mysterious fragment of a map that the former\u0027s father brings home from a fishing trip. Further investigations lead the hero to discover that the world he lives on, which seems to consist of only his small island, used to contain many continents that have somehow been sealed away. By placing other stone fragments found throughout the journey on pedestals in Estard\u0027s ruins, the Hero and his friends are sent to different lands in the past which the party eventually realizes. Once they solve the problems in the area\u0027s past, the landmasses appear in the present.\n\nAfter the world is restored, Orgodemir, the Demonlord, disguises himself as the Almighty and seals several of the islands away once again; this time Estard is sealed as well. The party sets out to revive the elemental spirits: Wind; Fire; Earth; and Water. Orgodemir is then revealed as the Demonlord to the world whereupon he claims to have done so to trick humanity. Orgodemir then raises the Cathedral of Blight; and with the aid of the Skystone, the party confronts him in a final battle.",

Armed conflict was soon unavoidable and the Laputa was destroyed soon after its engines exploded. The few survivors, who barely made it out alive by escaping in space shuttles, find another deserted Laputa in space. This Laputa is equipped with a landing pod to Earth, rumored to be long lost. Now you lead the remaining survivors of the Laputa and re-establish contact with Earth and the mysteries within.",
    "summary": "UFO: Aftershock is a combination of tactical squad combat and global strategy that enhances and expands upon its prequel, UFO: Aftermath.\n\nIt is the year 2054. Fifty years after the disaster. Fifty years after the surface of Earth became uninhabitable. Retreating to the flying haven of the Laputa the remnants of humankind clung onto existence. Then a revolt against the increasingly rigid and corrupt human leadership of the Laputa escalated into a conflict that destroyed the colony. Now, the remaining survivors flee once again. Can they reclaim the Earth from the unknown forces that chased them into the skies?",

    "storyline": "It was in 1695 when Elizabeth Ainsley was accused of being a witch. She was betrayed by the one person she cared for the most, Rev James Beaumont. Little did he know the terror he was about to unleash upon the small town of Shady Hollow.\n\nIt wouldn’t be until the 1940’s before the Beaumont family would return to Shady Hollow. Cliff and Linda Beaumont along with their children Sally and John moved to Shady Hollow to open a coal mining operation. The woods outside of Shady Hollow were known to be rich with coal, and being in the coal business, the Beaumonts’ saw this as a great opportunity.\n\nSeveral months after their arrival, their daughter Sally went missing. For weeks, the towns people searched the woods and the coal mines but all they would find is a shoe belonging to Sally by the Hollow Creek. Most believed that Sally must have fallen into the creek and drowned while others believed it was the curse of The Hollow Creek Witch.\n\nA year later, both Cliff and Linda Beaumont grew ill and soon died. It was rumored that the loss of their daughter was too much for them to handle. John, being the sole remaining member of the Beaumont family was taken to an orphanage.\n\nAbout thirty five years later (1975), John, now a grown man was approached by another mining company looking to buy the rights to the Beaumont Coal Company. The coal company was abandoned after the death of his parents so John agreed to sell his share of the company. On the morning of March 15th, 1975, John and two miners would travel through the woods to take mineral samples at one of the more lucrative mining sites in Shady Hollow. John would be the only person to return from that trip.\n\nAfter several searches, the two miners were found. What the police saw would haunt them the rest of their lives. John Beaumont was immediately arrested for the murders and spent his remaining days in the Shady Hollow Mental Hospital.\n\nIn the spring of 2015, 5 indie film makers travel to Shady Hollow to do a documentary about the disappearance of the two miners in 1975 and the Beaumont family. After arriving, they soon find out that the townspeople of Shady Hollow don’t welcome outsiders and are resistant to speak about the troubled past of the town. They soon begin to uncover the urban legend of the Hollow Creek Witch that haunts the woods surrounding Shady Hollow.",
    "summary": "A Haunting : Witching Hour is a storytelling Virtual Reality game of dark horror and desperate survival. An immersive experience finds players discovering – and taking part in – a rich story that explores the dark corners of human nature. It will unfold in episodes, giving players the opportunity to continue to unravel a complex mystery through downloadable content that picks up where the previous episode’s cliffhanger left off.\n\nIt is scheduled for release on both PC and console platforms.\n\nEpisode One follows an indie film crew who travels to Shady Hollow to produce a documentary on John Beaumont and the disappearance of the 2 miners. In 1975 John was accused and convicted of murdering two coal miners. During the investigation, John claimed it was the Hollow Creek Witch responsible for the disappearance of the miners.\n\nPlayers take on the role of Eddie, a character with a checkered past who has psychic abilities that allows him to see things from the past while touching items found throughout the game. The game will start off with Eddie being found along a lonely road by police. The police bring Eddie in for questioning in regards to the whereabouts of the remaining film makers. As Eddie tells his story, players are taken to that point in the story and play through what happened at that point.",
