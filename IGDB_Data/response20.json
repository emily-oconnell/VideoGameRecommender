The events of the game take place shortly before those of \"Eve Burst Error\". Kojiroh is working at Katsuragi Detective Office together with his girlfriend Yayoi. Dr. Nishina, the head of a genetic research facility, hires Kojiroh to investigate the disappearance of his son Shin. At the same time, Marina receives an assignment from her boss Kono, which involves watching over a representative of an American company. As in all EVE games, the two stories appear unrelated in the beginning and are gradually linked together later in the game. \n \nEver wondered what was Marina\u0027s previous assignment, with whom did Kyoko Himuro work before, or what exactly happened to Genzaburo Katsuragi when he was still the chief of Katsuragi Detective Office? Cared to know more about the appealing protagonist, Kojiroh Amagi? \"Eve Zero\" gives the answers to those questions.",

    "storyline": "The first and second playthroughs follow the respective views of 2B and 9S during an initial invasion. After opening a route for future missions, they are sent to clear out machine threats for the Resistance, led by Anemone, who provides the two with support. During their missions, 2B and 9S discover that the machines are exploring human societies and concepts. The two work with a pacifist machine group led by Pascal; battle Adam and Eve, physical manifestations of the machine network who reveal that their creators were destroyed centuries ago and encounter A2, a rogue android on the run from YoRHa. Adam is killed by 2B after he captures 9S. During his recuperation, 9S discovers a glitch in YoRHa\u0027s servers when syncing himself and 2B, and learns that humanity was extinct long before the alien invasion. Their last remnant is a Moon-based server holding humanity\u0027s incomplete genome remains. YoRHa perpetuates the myth of their survival to maintain morale and give androids a \"god\" to fight for. With Adam dead, Eve goes mad with grief and drives the machines under his command into a frenzy. 2B and 9S kill Eve to end the rampage, but 9S becomes infected with Eve\u0027s logic virus, forcing 2B to kill him. However, 9S\u0027s consciousness survives within the local machine network. \n \nThe third playthrough begins as YoRHa launches a full-scale invasion. A logic virus attack—enabled by the \"glitch\" that 9S previously discovered—corrupts every YoRHa unit including those in the Bunker, except for 2B and the restored 9S. 2B and 9S are separated in the aftermath, and 2B is infected with the logic virus. Discovered by A2, 2B uploads her memories into her sword and asks her to look after 9S. An ignorant 9S witnesses A2 mercifully killing 2B and swears revenge on her. Simultaneously, a tower created by the machines rises from the land, separating the two before they can fight. The perspective splits between A2 and 9S a fortnight after these events. A2—the survivor of a test run for YoRHa—finds herself empathising with the machines; she witnesses Pascal\u0027s village being destroyed, then its \"children\" committing suicide out of fear when attacked. Pascal begs A2 to either wipe his memory or kill him; A2 can perform either task or leave him. An increasingly-unbalanced 9S investigates the tower\u0027s resource-gathering platforms, fighting machine remnants and learning the tower is designed to launch a missile at the Moon server. Both eventually enter the tower, with Devola and Popola sacrificing themselves to open it.",

It is the thirteenth and final game in the beatmania series and is part of the BEMANI franchise. \n \nThe game is played with a controller with one turn table and 5 keys, three white and two black. On the screen you will see bars moving from the top to bottom in columns representing each of the keys and the turntable. When the bars reach the judgement line it is time to scratch. \n \nThe focus of the game is to make the ultimate beatmania version, thus a huge amount of songs was brought back. Because of this the game had to make some sacrifices due to memory limitations. Movies are now displayed in a little box with generic animations from the series playing. Only a few songs have unique clips. The miss animations are missing because of this as well. \n \nDetailed judgement information is now present on the side of play, like the one you could enable in 7thMIX. STEALTH was added as a modifier. \n \nSongs from the entire series except from DREAMS COME TRUE show up. 116 songs were restored from earlier games in the series. An additional 62 new songs were added for a total of 178 songs. The largest song list in the entire series.",

Yet only in 2027, in a sudden flash of enlightenment, Dr. P.Golabek of CDDA Labs realized the true potential hidden in the unloved part of his meal. There was more to the boiled curd of the brassica oleracea than what it seemed on the surface. The discovery didn\u0027t go unnoticed, and instead of bringing prosperity and nutrition, the wondrous plant became outlawed along with significant number of unrelated species of brassicaceae family. The time has come to put an end to it and let the cauliflower bloom everywhere! Welcome to the Cauliflower Research Liberation Front, comrade!",

He hopes to collect enough crystals to start a profitable twibble farm. \n \nCrystal Caves is a side-scrolling platform game, where the objective is to finish all 16 levels, collecting every single crystal within. On his way, Mylo is threatened by numerous monsters, such as bats, robots, mine carts or dinosaurs; there are also a lot of hazards such as stalactites and stalagmites, pipes which leak harmful water or poisonous mushrooms which kill instantly. Mylo has three health points, and if he is harmed enough times to deplete them all, he dies (but thankfully he has unlimited lives). To defend himself, Mylo has a missile pistol, which is able to take out most enemies, but not all. Many levels require the player to act fast and plan beforehand, as it\u0027s easy to get Mylo stuck in an impossible-to-win situation - if this happens, the level must be restarted. \n \nApart from the crystals, the levels contain a lot of items to collect: ammunition for the pistol, bonus items such as pickaxes or purple mushrooms that give score, and eggs which turn into letters when shot - collecting all 5 letters (B, O, N, U, S) on a level gives a lot of points, but it\u0027s not always easy to get them! It\u0027s also possible to find a power-up that reverses gravity when picked up, another one which gives your pistol the power to kill every enemy, a stop sign which freezes all enemies and makes them harmless and a red mushroom which allows you to kill enemies by running into them. These power-ups last only for a limited time though, so be careful, as they are always instrumental to victory!",

But there is a house nearby her own that is known for containing some source of creativity: as it is the only part of the town with color. She is told to never enter.\nOne day, however, she does, and enters the world of another fourth-grader named Toby, who also lives in a world bereft of creativity. He is the only one who can see her, which makes him appear insane, if his aberrational personality and appearance weren\u0027t enough. After a certain amount of time, however, she disappears back to her own world, leaving him alone until she enters the house again. As a part of his mind, she witnesses the climbs and downfalls of his subconscious.",

In each round, the player places a disc that falls from the top of the grid. Each disc has a number 1-7, or a blank. Whenever the number of any disc matches the number of contiguous discs in a row or column, that disc disappears and also hits any blank discs it touches. When a blank is hit twice, it turns into a numbered disc. After a number of turns, the round ends and a full row of blank discs emerges from the bottom of the grid. There is no time limit, and discs may be dropped at the player\u0027s leisure. The objective is to eliminate discs and score combos for as long as possible until either the grid overflows or the grid is full and it is impossible to place another disc. If the player clears the screen of all discs, then the player is given a 70,000 point bonus.",

It facilitates this play and provides some optional add-on Adventure modules which can be loaded and played with very little preparation. Each game will require a GameMaster (GM) and one or more players. Games may be played in a session as short as a few hours or continued with multiple sessions over a series of days, weeks, months or years. A GM will typically install the application and choose their game-system of choice, which we refer to as a Ruleset. Fantasy Grounds comes pre-loaded with Rulesets for FATE Core, Numenera, Dungeons \u0026 Dragons 3.5, Dungeons \u0026 Dragons 4E, Dungeons \u0026 Dragons fifth edition and the Pathfinder RPG. Additional Rulesets are available for free and for purchase from our Workshop. Dungeons \u0026 Dragons 3.5, D\u0026D fifth edition and Pathfinder are good places to start for new GMs and for people new to Fantasy Grounds. These Rulesets come pre-loaded with some basic Library modules full of abilities, spells, monsters and items.",

Each round also has a preset time limit to ensure that the player does not dawdle - and once it runs out, a green-haired female vampire known as Tsukaima (who cannot be crushed by the walls) shall appear in search of Chap\u0027s blood, as the Yamaha YM2151-generated song (and all the enemies) speed up. The game\u0027s enemies include white blobs known as Pyokorin, pink Triceratops-esque creatures known as Kerara which can breathe flames, armadillos known as Gororin which can roll over Chap, purple seals known as Todorin which can breathe ice, sponges known as Bekabeka, which can push walls onto Chap, turquoise blobs known as Fumajime Pyokorin, which occasionally pause to take a long drag on their cigarettes, helmet-wearing creatures known as Nachibo, which take two crushes to kill, wolves known as Taggus which can throw bombs at Chap, spiders known as Oogumo, which can spin webs for Chap to run into - and this game\u0027s main antagonist, an evil scientist named Gurerin who only appears on the final round, where players not only have to collect all the keys, but also push the walls onto his four clones (two of whom can breathe fire, but the other two can breathe ice). \n \nA cutscene called \"The Rompers Show\" also appears after every tenth round, and once Chap has rescued Rumina at the end of the game, they both go back to free Tsukaima (who, ironically, is trapped under a wall, given that she cannot be crushed by them in the game), and wrap her feet up with bandages; Chap then starts to carry Tsukaima off on his back, which angers Rumina as he went through a lot to save her.",

The more explosions you cause, the bigger your score.  \n  \nIf you’re feeling burnt out by congestion and jammed roads, take the highway to the Danger Zone. Take your revenge on rush hour traffic.

    "summary": "The game tells another story in Ninja-kun series. This time it’s a platform game with some twists. There are two tasks alternating through levels: you are required either to kill every enemy in the level (as in the previous games) or simply to reach the exit. Running into enemies usually won’t kill you, however if you are hit by a single projectile, you’ll have to start from a checkpoint. Enemies vary from plain ninjas to giant skeletons or killer fish. Each level has a time limit, and when this limit is close to an end a fire wheel of death will appear on the screen, chasing Ninja-kun.\n\nNinja-kun has some techniques for successful progression though the levels: many enemies can be temporarily stunned by jumping on them or hitting them from below; and ninja can obtain some power-ups including boomerang, bombs, a devastating fire attack or invincibility. Ninja-kun is capable of wall climbing and wall jumping, the latter requiring some practice from the player.\n\nThe levels (called “scenes” in-game) are scattered through mountains, caves, beaches and underwater locations. You can choose which set of levels you’ll start in by playing a mini-game at the beginning.",

The difficulty is quite high: best weapons are rare, and many enemies kill player instantly despite having a shield bar. There is a two player mode.",

Dennis must use a variety of vehicles (motorbike, jet-ski and ski-doo) to perform a number of stunts. The only controls are accelerate, brake and jump. The screen is split into four platforms. When the character leaves the end of one, he appears at the start of the next but there are also (on most levels), gaps in the platform where the character can fall through and land on the platform below. There are many hazards scattered across the platforms that must be avoided. These range from static objects like trees and houses to moving objects such as jumping policemen and speeding ambulances. If Dennis hits any of these objects, he is flung from his vehicle as it bursts into flames and he must start again (with \u0027take 2\u0027). If he crashes too many times, he is \u0027fired\u0027. Points are given in the form of a wage.",

And, an oldie called Death Tanks was also a Game that we enjoyed, and admired the format of everything happening in one screen. Both of these Games have inspired Nebulas Lasso\u0027s design to a fair degree.\nThank you for reading!\n\nSummary:\nNebulas Lasso is a local multiplayer Game, where each player pilots a UFO with it’s unique pilot and unique style to capture people of earth.

    "storyline": "Prologue \nNine months after the |Joker\u0027s death, crime rates in Gotham City have dramatically declined, but Batman anticipates a new threat and maintains a vigil over the city. Before his death, the Joker sent his mutated blood to Gotham\u0027s hospitals, and several patients were infected. While most were cured, the patients who were not treated are starting to look and act like the Joker. Batman researches a cure for the mutations, and orders Robin to watch over the infected. \n \nThe Arkham Knight \nOn Halloween night, Scarecrow unleashes his newest strain of Fear Gas in a diner, and threatens to release it throughout Gotham. Six million civilians are evacuated, but the city\u0027s criminals and supervillains stay behind, leaving Commissioner James Gordon and the Gotham City Police Department outnumbered. Batman investigates Scarecrow\u0027s presence, and searches for him in a rooftop safehouse, but instead finds and saves Poison Ivy, who was being held captive by Scarecrow\u0027s henchmen. In a makeshift Batcave in Gotham\u0027s Clock Tower, Barbara Gordon is collecting information on Scarecrow\u0027s new toxin, and traces its production to Ace Chemicals. Batman goes to investigate, but is confronted by the mysterious \"Arkham Knight\" and his militia, which has a massive army of unmaned tanks. Batman fights his way through the militia, learning from workers that Scarecrow is planning to produce a chemical explosion so large that it will cover the entire eastern seaboard in fear toxin. Batman reaches Scarecrow, who reveals to him that Barbara has been abducted by the Arkhan Knight before escaping. While reducing the blast radius, Batman is exposed to the fear toxin, which reacts with his own mutated blood to cause hallucinations of the Joker. Escaping from the exploding Ace Chemicals, Batman is forced to tell Gordon about his daughter\u0027s involvement in his crime-fighting, and the outraged Gordon swears that he will find Barbara without Batman\u0027s help. \n \nScarecrow\u0027s Plans \nBatman tracks the Arkham Knight to an underground tunnel network, hoping to learn Barbara\u0027s whereabouts from him, but instead gets ambushed by him. Batman then gives chase to the escaping convoy, only to learn that the driver is a decoy, using a voice synthesizer that makes him sound like the Arkham Knight. Batman interrogates the driver and learns that they are heading to the North Refrigeration. He and Nightwing interrogate the Penguin, who tells them that the Knight and Scarecrow are meeting with a businessman named Simon Stagg, who runs a pharmaceutical company. After boarding Stagg\u0027s airship, Batman discovers that Scarecrow paid Stagg to create a device known as the \"Cloudburst\", but Stagg tried to double-cross them and has been doused with fear toxin as punishment. After reaching Scarecrow and interrogating Stagg, Batman is again exposed to the toxin, which triggers a powerful hallucinogenic response. Scarecrow escapes with the Cloudburst. Batman receives a message from Scarecrow revealing that Barbara is in the same safehouse where Ivy was held, but before Batman can save her, Barbara is doused with fear toxin and shoots herself in the head. Batman and Alfred Pennyworth are devastated, but Alfred convinces Batman to not lose hope, for Barbara\u0027s sake. Alfred explains to Batman that the Cloudburst is a dispersal device designed to flood all of Gotham with the fear toxin. To counteract this effect, Batman enlists the help of Ivy, who takes control of a large tree which develops giant flowers capable of neutralizing the toxin.",

Depending upon the selected character, players can make use of tail whipping, head butting, and other abilities to build bridges, ride geysers, and overcome other obstacles. Petrie is also readily available to fly onscreen and offer advice and direction. Levels are composed of obstacle courses and puzzle-type action as players need to cross rivers, feed plants, and collect treestars while avoiding hazards, such as lava, water, and steep cliffs. After all five characters exit the fifth level, they are all reunited in the Great Valley.",

    "summary": "Adidas Power Soccer kicks its way onto the PlayStation. You are given a wide variety of gameplay options to choose from, such as season and tournament modes, single games, and multiplayer. \n \nWhen going through the season mode, you can play either a shortened season or an official full-length season. Your team, as well as your opponents, are taken from all over Europe and other countries. If you\u0027re interested in reaching supreme glory at a quicker pace, there is an option for cup battle. Like it implies, you\u0027ll have to beat a certain number of teams in tournament fashion to claim your prize. \n \nThe game can be played two different ways, arcade or simulation. By choosing the arcade mode, you won\u0027t have to worry about soccer physics or penalties whereas the simulation goes by actual soccer rules. If you lay into someone\u0027s shin, you\u0027ll probably get called for a penalty. Depending on the severity of the penalty, the game will switch to a penalty shot mode, just like real soccer.",
