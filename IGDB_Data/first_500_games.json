Each ship is designed to meet specialized standards so that no matter how young or old you are you can enjoy them just the same.\n\nMost PixelShips are only a foot or two long and are flown using special devices called PICCs, or PixelShip Interface Command Consoles. The consoles have two joysticks and six buttons on each stick and can interface with any ship that has been registered into it. Some PICCs also have LCD displays so that you don\u0027t need a TV to see what your PixelShip sees while it flies.\n\nEach PixelShip uses batteries, just like any other toy, though some use Micro-Reactors instead and are fueled at special facilities so that childeren cannot actually access the fuel inside. They are also designed out of segments held together by micro-magnets. When the ship is \"destroyed\" in combat, its micro-magnets disengage and the ship flies apart into its seperate segments, each still carrying a residual charge from the ship\u0027s anti-gravity unit. If all of the segments are then tagged by another PixelShip, that collector may then, under official guidelines, possess the ship if he so desires.\n\nClassic PixelShips takes place in the year 2076 when a very secretive PixelShip has supposedly been built. Your task is to collect all 160 known PixelShips by earning them through campaign battles at the arena. Afterwards, you will be given access to a special campaign where you may earn this unique and unheard of PixelShip.",

Not only was he the school bus driver for the cute and petite students, but he was also entrusted as the manager of the girls’ dormitory.

Nono was exceptionally gifted, having skipped many grades and becoming a teacher, even though she was the same size as the students in her class. Under the guise of a silly sex education lesson, the students began to be conscious of him as a man. Will he be able to hold it together?",

Her only escape is her sketchbook and paintings in which she draws and paints to deal with life challenges. She is struggling to find inner peace with what has happened through her life. Her paintings of life changing incidents are both drawn from logical perspective of Mr. Ruppel or the chaotic view of Ms. Schmidt and you have to help her find the balance between these ever-conflicting feelings. Each scene and level tells a part of Lona\u0027s life story and the way she tries to deal with real life difficulties. You have to solve puzzles and use items important to her to try and bring her peace of mind.\n\nLona\u0027s story will be narrated in a non linear fashion with no dialogues and conventional narration methods. Instead you have to piece together all the clues given through levels, puzzles and an insane symphony of visual arts. This is our way of narrating a story of extreme emotions, one\u0027s inner conflicts and fighting to win against hardships of real life via a unique story telling medium called video game!\"",

Gates were one-way trips to random destinations, often taking one far across the galaxy. No-one knew a new gate\u0027s ultimate destination until it was finished and the first journey undertaken. \n \nGatestriders, a nomadic colony of humanity, took pride in gate travel and the discovery of new areas of space. When resource rich planets were discovered, they would send Reaper teams to terraform the planet and mine its wealth for fortune and glory. \n \nOne such foray inadvertently led them into a region of space deemed forbidden by the reclusive, yet powerful, Enshigi. \n \nThe retaliation was swift, and ruthless. Within a week the Gatestriders lost their homeworld, their star sent nova by the Enshigi. \n \nThe shattered society took to finding a new home for themselves. It was during this search that they came across the planet Em-8ER. This was where they encountered the Tsi-Hu: sentient, shapeshifting aliens who command huge creatures, known as Kaiju, into battle. This was how the war started.",

Hundreds of players will be fighting at any given time in skirmishes involving mechs, giant monsters, and military bases. EM-8ER combines high action, 1st and 3rd person shooting with crafting and RTS-like elements in a vast open world. We call this genre: Massive Planetary Wargame.",

It is fundamentally different from most solitaire games in that nearly all deals can be solved. Although software implementations vary, most versions label the hands with a number (derived from the random number seed used to generate the hand).\n\nRules\n\nConstruction and layout:\n\n* One standard 52-card deck is used.\n* There are four open cells and four open foundations. Some alternate rules use between one to ten cells.\n* Cards are dealt into eight cascades, four of which comprise seven cards and four of which comprise six. Some alternate rules will use between four to ten cascades.\n\nBuilding during play:\n\n* The top card of each cascade begins a tableau.\n* Tableaux must be built down by alternating colors.\n* Foundations are built up by suit.\n\nMoves:\n\n* Any cell card or top card of any cascade may be moved to build on a tableau, or moved to an empty cell, an empty cascade, or its foundation.\n* Complete or partial tableaus may be moved to build on existing tableaus, or moved to empty cascades, by recursively placing and removing cards through intermediate locations. While computer implementations often show this motion, players using physical decks typically move the tableau at once.\n\nVictory:\n\n* The game is won after all cards are moved to their foundation piles.\n\nFor games with the standard layout (four open cells and eight cascades) most games are easily solved.\n\nSupported Operations:\n* Tap one column and tap another column, move the cards from the first column to second column if possible;\n* Double Tap on the column\u0027s last card to move it to buffer area, if possible;\n* Drag cards from one column to another column, if possible;\n* Auto throw, cards will be throw to recycle automatically, if possible;\n* Drag from recycle to columns to restore the recycled card, if possible;\n\nWith Auto-throw, it is much more convenient to finish the card puzzle!\nEnjoy it, players!",

    "summary": "Invisigun Heroes is a multiplayer, single-screen stealth battle arena with a twist: everyone’s invisible! Predictable grid-based movement ensures that you know where you are, but other players don’t. Vigilance is key as environmental tells such as footprints and other disturbances will point out careless cadets. Using special abilities and firing your Invisigun will also momentarily give you away. Along with items and powerups, these mechanics reward stealth, trickery, reflex, forethought, deception, bluffing, and awareness. A variety of lovingly-made environments, maps, game modes, and abilities combine for high replayability and a deep path to mastery.",

    "summary": "In the 24th century, Earth is pounded by solar explosions and abandoned by humans, and the planet is recolonized by a dangerous race known as Kat Men. When the solar explosions died, the humans decide to return to Earth. When the Kat Men refuse to leave, a war droid known as MT-ED, or Multi Terrain Exploration Droid, is sent down to deal with the Kat Men. Accompanying him is Hercules 1, a maintenance and combat droid. When the two droids are beamed down, things take a turn for the worse. Hercules is kidnapped and taken far away to the Kat Men\u0027s Nerve Center. It is MT-ED\u0027s task to get rid of the Kat Men and rescue Hercules. \n \nTo do this, MT-ED has to explore fourteen environments and deal with deadly creatures that are within each environment, with each type of creature requiring a certain type of weapon to be defeated. These weapons - including lasers, water bombs, grenades, and rockets - can be picked up along the way, and MT-ED can switch between them with ease. If MT-ED comes into contact with any of the creatures, he is kicked into the air and gets stunned for a few seconds. If this happens, he loses one of his lives. Not all creatures are deadly; some of them will steal whatever weapons MT-ED is carrying at the time. \n \nBesides using weapons to kill, MT-ED also has the ability to jump over creatures that may be too slow for him to shoot. When MT-ED finally rescues Hercules, a sub-game needs to be completed. When MT-ED completed this sub-game, the Kat Men\u0027s Central Computer is disabled and the Kat Men go back where they came from.",

This game is part one of a two part story, some questions are left unanswered and open to interpretation. To thank our fans for our successful Greenlight campaign, we have added new voiceovers, clues and storylines, and also made the Oculus Rift demo available (which will update to the full version on its release). \n \nThe mixture of cold Atlantic water and coarse sand in your mouth brings you back from unconsciousness. Surrounded by the wreckage of a boat’s hull, you can only draw one conclusion: your vessel has been torn apart by the submerged rocks. The secrets of the island must be uncovered if you are ever going to find a way to escape. Where is everyone; is the island really uninhabited; and what is lurking within the isolated caves?",

Along with the new quests and area content, the team at Obsidian continues to support and make improvements to the entire game, including the additions of Player Party AI and Enhanced Enemy AI. Even if you haven\u0027t played Pillars of Eternity, now is a great time to jump in and experience the hardcore classic RPG with The White March - Part I. \n \nMain features \n-Raised level cap: Your party of six adventurers can now progress beyond level 12 to 14. The additional levels add powerful new spells, abilities and talents for all 11 classes. \n-New areas to explore: Largely focused on the snowy environments inspired by Icewind Dale, the expansion will feature a new quest hub, and many additional quests and dungeons. \n-Soulbound weapons: The expansion features mighty artifacts that grow stronger over time. These weapons gain different powers and attributes depending on the character class that binds to it. \n-New companions: Part 1 of the expansion introduces two new companions you will be able to use throughout all of your adventures. The Devil of Caroc, a rogue, and Zahua, a monk, will be available to join you on your quest in The White March and will travel back with you into the base game. \n-Multi-class talents: Classes will now have additional options to diversify and take on some of the abilities of other classes. \n-Party AI: Now you will have the option to set AI scripts for your party, allowing you to focus on controlling the characters you care about most. \n-Enhanced Enemy AI: Enemies and monsters are now smarter than ever. The new AI makes the entire game more of a challenge, and spell casters will use a wider variety of their spells in more devastating ways. \n-Respec: At any inn or tavern the player can re-level their party members. It gives flexibility for the player to experiment with the RPG systems and try out builds with the newly added multi-class talents. If you aren\u0027t completely satisfied with your character, you can now do a rebuild and start over fresh.",

A platform game with some puzzle solving elements. Michael Jakobsen’s puzzle-platformer, centred around a castle, requires players to find five hidden crystals and return them to their rightful place. Outside of the castle there are outside areas (including a wasteland, a pyramid, a sea and an island). \n \nUpon returning the crystals, the player must teleport to a separate set of locations to complete the game. Once the game is completed, the player is left free to roam the castle in order to achieve the maximum possible score if they have not done so already. The only way to see the final congratulatory message is to reach 99 points. \n \nCitadel was unusual at the time for playing synthesized speech before loading the main game (in part to advertise Superior Software\u0027s \"Speech!\" programme package), as well as having other special effects advanced for the time, such as splashing water sounds. Many BBC Micro gamers regard Citadel as a seminal game and it has spawned social media appreciation pages.",

The package contained a small handheld device called a Dual Another System, or \"DAS\" (Dual Trace System, DTS in the American release), along with an invitation to meet him on Blood Edward Island. The following day, her and her aunt , Jessica Robbins, set off for the island. While there, Ashley meets \"D\", a ghost with no memories, who has been wandering the island alone for decades since his death. Ashley attempts to aide D in uncovering his lost memories, while also uncovering the truth about her father, the murder of her murder, and the mysterious project, code named \"Another\".",
    "summary": "The events of the game take place on the fictional Blood Edward Island. The game\u0027s protagonist, Ashley Mizuki Robbins, is the daughter of Richard and Sayoko Robbins, researchers of human memory. After her parents mysteriously went missing in 1994, they were presumed dead.Consequently, Ashley was raised by her father\u0027s younger sister, Jessica Robbins, in the suburbs of Seattle. Eleven years later, two days before her fourteenth birthday, Ashley receives a package from her father containing a birthday card and a device called a DAS. The DAS, programmed to respond only to Ashley\u0027s biometrics, contains a message from her father, claiming that he is waiting for her on Blood Edward Island. \nAssuming control of Ashley Robbins, players navigate through 3D environments and attempt to solve puzzles. During movement, the touchscreen displays an aerial view of Ashley and her surroundings. The player can move Ashley using a point and click system, dragging the stylus across the screen, or using the D-pad. The top screen shows pre-rendered images of the player\u0027s current location. To solve puzzles encountered in the game, the player must use the touchscreen, or other DS capabilities, such as the DS microphone.",

The pigs are well fed, but they create more waste than the land can handle. The greenhouses are put on gigantic floating platforms which float above a literal sea of... waste. The land below can not support life. But the pigs just keep eating and don\u0027t seem to care. \n \nUrchin is a flying pig from this city. Urchin wants to be an explorer. So one day he up and flew into the distance. He saw many interesting lands, but suddenly strange creatures and flying dinnerware came at him. He quickly realized they were trying to eat him! Urchin is flying home - and you can help! Use your light phaser (or control pad) to shoot down foes while Urchin flies home. Protect your pork!",

It contained characters from Bakugan: Gundalian Invaders, though the game was largely set independent of the game\u0027s timeline. \n \nAt the beginning of the game, after the character creation menu, players were supplied with three default Bakugan in their chosen attribute. They did not gain experience and levels as quickly, but could be used without making any purchases. To acquire additional Bakugan, DNA Codes found on real-life Gundalian Invaders and Mechtanium Surge Bakugan toys could be input into the game to acquire their game versions.",

Trigger scab plant chain reactions to earn score multipliers and chain bonus points.  Collect Orb essence to boost your score, or grab them in mid-air to earn an aerial combo bonus.  Seek out and destroy the hidden Orb brains and collect all of the Orb essence in each level for even more points. \n \nEarn experience points to upgrade your weapons and skills, including “Absorbtion” which pulls points towards you automatically!  Unlock the secrets of “Hard Hologram” technology to deploy mobile shields or aerial landing platforms.",

Create a team strategy and synergize your 11 team members’ abilities to get past the enemies of the tower! In addition to fighting, remember to develop bonds in between battles, as that is key to finding the traitor in your midst. Once you reach the Judgement phase, you’ll be forced to eliminate your enemies (or allies!) on each floor until you reach the top.

To investigate comes the plucky adventurer, Moth, but what lies in store is a secret too vast to be contained by mere castle walls. Prepare to enter an imaginative fantasy world of bugs, battles and bravery in Creepy Castle!",
    "summary": "Creepy Castle is an exploratory sidescrolling RPG about a moth in a castle. It\u0027s a fresh adventure with the look of a classic, but don\u0027t let the retro paintjob fool you; this is a new-school experience. Traditional turn-based combat meets an energetic twist in the form of Duels, where instead of taking turns doling out damage, you are offered a chance to score free hits on your opponent if you perform excellently... but don\u0027t let your guard down, or you might find yourself pummeled!",
