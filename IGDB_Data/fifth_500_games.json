Youre cold, hungry and disoriented.\n\nWelcome to The Cell — break out or die trying.\n\nCELL season one saw Michael Spencer (SPENCE) become embroiled in a bare-knuckle fighting league in the dangerous underworld of the Colombian capital Bogotá.

For the first time, both club and national teams were present, plus other teams (such as Arsenal LFC) and various joke teams. While its predecessor had been criticized for the absence of club teams, Actua Soccer 3 featured a total of 25 leagues with 450 national and international teams, more than any game of the time except the earlier Sensible World of Soccer as well as over 10000 players. The graphics used a slightly improved version of the Actua Soccer 2 engine with much improved weather effects. Trevor Brooking was replaced by Martin O\u0027Neill as Barry Davies\u0027 commentary partner. \"Let Me Entertain You\" by Robbie Williams was the only ingame soundtrack the classical operatic theme Cavalleria Rusticana (Rustic Chivalry) by Pietro Mascagni was played during the game\u0027s introduction video.",

This was released by Exidy in 1983 and written by Vic Tolomei and Larry Hutcherson hopeful to play on the Trivial Pursuit craze as it was released over a year earlier than the registered Trivial Pursuit versions (produced by Bally/Sente).\n\nThe game came in what was essentially a jukebox cabinet (complete with a woodgrain finish), which lent itself to possible markets outside of the typical arcade setting. It had a 9-inch monitor mounted in the center, logo on the bezel itself and a row of buttons on each side of the screen to accommodate two player simultaneous play. Fax used unique compression to hold nearly 3700 questions in as small of storage as possible. Exidy also sold several EPROM replacement kits that provided new questions but they are nearly impossible to find today.",

There is also a Home Run Derby mode, allowing the player to pelt the ball out of the ground for points.\n\nYou can choose pitchers and batters, based on their statistics and form. Bowling options are set to define the delivery, with fastballs and curveballs as well as more precise setting of pace and height. Fielding is optional - it\u0027s best to leave this to the computer at first You can always alter the infield and outfield depth and shift.",

Meanwhile, his son Callum \"Rascal\" Clockwise is walking through a secret route under the house to get to his father\u0027s lab when suddenly the lights go out and an alarm sounds. Rascal rushes down to see the problem, but to his horror two aliens in spacecraft appear and chase him down the corridor. \n \nRascal finally makes it to his father\u0027s lab by going through the safe door entrance. He is shocked to find Chronon, the evil master of time, torturing his dad for unknown reasons, and holding him at gunpoint with another of his dad\u0027s inventions called the \"Bubble Gun\", but Chronon accidentally activates the controls for the time machine and he and the Professor are sucked into the time portal. The Bubble Gun manages to be released from the portal and lands at the feet of Rascal, who picks it up, vowing to save his dad. \n \nRascal chases the two through time, from the medieval Castle Hackalott, to the Aztec Temple at Chichimeca, to the lost city of Atlantis, to the Jolly Raider pirate ship and Dodgy City in the old West, travelling to each location\u0027s past and present forms and collecting the pieces of a Time Clock from both before fighting Chronon in each area\u0027s future. Afterwards Rascal travels to the Corridors of Time, Chronon\u0027s lair within the space-time continuum where, after defeating its guardians brought from each of the other time periods, he successfully defeats Chronon and rescues his dad. After escaping using another time portal, Rascal and his dad safely return home, leaving the portal to shatter and trap Chronon in interdimensional time forever.",

In each past and present level, the player has to find the six pieces of the Time Clock in order to access the Time Bubble at the end and be able to access the next form of that world. Each future level has a boss fight against Chronon. Defeating him in all five gives access to the final world. The Bubble Gun has limited ammo, and which bubbles it shoots depends on how much ammo is left.",

    "storyline": "Defiance continues from where Soul Reaver 2 ended. In Soul Reaver 2, Kain saved Raziel\u0027s life by drawing the Soul Reaver from him - Raziel was meant to enter the blade and become its soul-devouring spectral half. This causes a paradox that changes time for the worse, and separates Kain and Raziel. \n \nKain\u0027s part of the game follows him seeking Moebius the Time Streamer, a time traveling mystic for answers to where Raziel is, how he has changed time, and later following a lead Moebius gives him to explore a Vampire citadel. During his quest, Kain finds and completes a broken talisman of Vampire construct known as the Balance Emblem. Kain discovers murals during his quest dictating an ancient war between the first races to inhabit Nosgoth, the Ancient vampires and the Hylden. After sealing the Hylden in an alternate dimension using the Pillars of Nosgoth, the Hylden cursed the Ancients with blood-thirst, sterility and immortality, turning them into the first Vampires. Kain discovers from the murals that it was prophesied that both races would have a champion arise - a Vampire champion wielding the Soul Reaver, and a Hylden champion wielding a flaming sword. Because he possesses the material Soul Reaver depicted, Kain comes to believe he is the prophesied Vampire champion. The outcome of the battle between the two champions remains ambiguous.",
    "summary": "Swords, sorcery, souls, and buckets of blood await you in Legacy of Kain: Defiance. Return to the corrupt world of Nosgoth, where the disfigured wraith Raziel pursues his creator, the vampire overlord Kain. Separated by their common enemies and time itself, the two anti-heroes must wage their own personal battles to discover what lies behind their destinies and defeat the vicious forces that seek to condemn their world to eternal damnation. While their foes plot and scheme, Kain and Raziel embark on a dark and twisted odyssey. In the end, only one of them may be left standing. \n \nThe final chapter in the epic Legacy of Kain series is a time-bending, dimension-crossing, action-adventure game featuring more fast-paced combat than ever before. Take control of two mighty and highly-evolved vampires, each with a vast arsenal of combat moves and elaborate combos to unlock during their journey. A world filled to the brim with gruesome monsters, conflict and intrigue lies before them.",

    "summary": "A remastered version of the 2012 release, Darksiders II.\n\nAwakened by the End of Days, Death, the most feared of the legendary Four Horsemen, embarks upon a quest to restore mankind, and redeem his brother\u0027s name. Along the way, the Horseman discovers that there are far worse things than an earthly Apocalypse, and that an ancient grudge may threaten all of Creation.\n\nDarksiders II follows the exploits of Death, one of the four horsemen of the Apocalypse, in an action-packed tale that runs parallel to the events in the original Darksiders game. This epic journey propels Death across an expansive gameworld as he tries to redeem his brother, War, the horseman blamed for prematurely starting the Apocalypse in Darksiders.\n\nLike the original Darksiders game before it, the second iteration of the series is primarily a hack \u0027n slash adventure. The game takes place across netherworld environments, including \u0027The White city\u0027, an outpost where angels live, and \u0027The Eternal Throne\u0027, a floating fortress where the Lords of the Dead stand guard over souls that need to be cleansed. Although Death is the most feared of the Four Horsemen, his physical abilities are very different than his brother, War. Death is far more nimble, and relies on a combination of melee and ranged attacks. In combat Death\u0027s primary weapon is his huge iconic scythe, with a wide range of other weapons and usable items that must be gathered as the game progresses. Weapons can be dual-wielded, upgradable armor can be acquired for protection and Death has access to his terrifying and powerful mount, Despair.",

Programmer Ron Surratt (Atari 2600 BurgerTime) and graphic artist Peggi Decarli (USCF Chess) drew up some initial concepts for the game (Ron\u0027s input was requested because he used to be a teacher), then Steve Ettinger was assigned as programmer. New-hire Joe Ferreira was added to train with Peggi as a graphics artist. Steve and Joe quickly became a strong design team, taking the concept from a barnyard to a carousel and making the game their own. By the time it was finished, however, Marketing decided that sales of Intellivoice units were too low to support such a \"specialty\" cartridge. Magic Carousel was shelved with the hope that a future increase in Intellivoice sales would justify the game\u0027s release. It never happened. \n \nSteve and Joe had proved themselves to be a formidable team, so they were chosen to design the top-secret experimental Intellivision game, Hover Force 3-D. \n \nEASTER EGG: Connect the twinkling stars above the carousel on the title screen to get SEE and JAF, Steve and Joe\u0027s initials.",

When these cyber violence continue to escalate, the consequences often exceed the incident itself, and even more stressful and end precious lives. Therefore, we decided to develop such a game related to the theme of \"hacking\", \"cyber manhunt\" and \"privacy data leakage\".

The most significant difference is that it features none of the original levels, since the eight worlds are all unique to this release and have a high level of difficulty surpassing even Super Mario Bros. 2.",

A brave sage appeared and, by using the Holy Instruments and the Dream Stone, sealed the Nightmare away into the holy land. Peace was restored but the world is now separated into the real world and dream world.\n\nYears later, people forgot what has happened, and only recalled the events as a legend. Many have also heard about the Dream Stone sealed within the Temple of Dreams. Enter our hero, Rumble, a Ruinseeker (a high ranked treasure hunter) who wish to find the Dream Stone. At the same time, in the Dreamworld, a Baku (a weird looking animal that lives in the Dreamworld) who Rumble later names Tumble accidentally drops the box which holds 7 keys to the seal of the Temple. The keys went and hid in different people\u0027s dreams. To retrieve them, one must enter the dream and seek out the keys. Tumble can enter the dreams but there are many monsters within dreams and puzzles that he may need help with. Rumble realize he must get the keys in order to find the Dream Stone. Seeing that the two can help meet each other\u0027s goals, Rumble and Tumble decides to work together.\n\nIn Dual Hearts, Rumble and Tumble will travel around Sonno Island, meeting the people there and seek out those whose dreams holds one of the seven keys. Each dream is different as each person is different, which means that the enemies and puzzles Rumble will encounter will be different in each dream he visits. Within the dreamworld, everything is filled with gold and gems - even the boss is a giant money bag.\n\nWithin the dreams, Rumble will be able to use the Holy Instruments (in the form of a spear and sword) to fight enemies there. Rumble can use both weapons at the same time enabling him to do a variety of combo attacks. Tumble will help Rumble by carrying him on his back, enabling him to reach higher planes. He can also perform different attacks like the Breath Attack.\n\nIn order to advance, there are a variety of puzzles for our heroes to solve. For example, in one puzzle, you will be presented with movable blocks, several switches and a closed door. You must figure out which switch will open the door and move the block on the switch. If you run into any problems, you can always talk to Tumble or the Dream Sheep for hints and help.",

What she doesn\u0027t know is that, next to the cottage, there\u0027s a large, run-down house from which emanates a macabre atmosphere. You play as Nancy Evans and it\u0027s up to you to investigate the strange phenomena coming from this gloomy house. According to Mary, it\u0027s haunted by ghosts. Indeed, her interest in mysticism has her thinking that the creaking that can be heard, the shadows wandering the halls, and the strange smell that sometimes prevails there are all supernatural in origin. Nancy explores the house and is amazed to discover that the spirits are trying to communicate with her, leaving messages for help in the world of the living. What exactly happened in this house to cause these spirits to be so unquiet?",

The story is focused on a society descended from people who couldn\u0027t afford to inhabit the \"city in the clouds\", called Deus, when the ecological disaster was imminent. Deus is a closed town built upon gigantic metal pillars - Columnae. Beneath them, a huge underground machine, called Machina, was constructed with the purpose of automatically extracting and processing resources and sending them via pipes through Columnae and into Deus. The society now living inside the columns settled there in an attempt to escape the lethal environment on the surface after Deus was locked down. Since then, they had no contact with the inhabitants of Deus, and they are parasitizing on the resources coming through the columns. But the people living there are far from innocent themselves - power struggle, corruption, lies, political manipulation and poverty are all present among the citizens of Columnae.",

The game is divided into eight chapters, but the order of playing them is not chronological. Depending on the actions the player chooses within each chapter of the game, yet-to-be-played chapters are placed in an appropriate \"version\" of the past or the future.",
