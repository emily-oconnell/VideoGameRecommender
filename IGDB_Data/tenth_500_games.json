The mages were students at the renowned Hocus-Pocus Academy of Applied Magicks. To keep Princess safe during their study hours, they installed a giant lock on the front door.\n\nOne day, the blue mage forgot to lock the door and when everyone came back home after a long day, their Princess was gone.\n\nA fairy beared terrible news: “Strange things are happening in the old Demon Fortress atop Pretzel Mountain!”\n\nThe four mages did not hesitate. After chanting a teleportation spell they had just learned at the Academy, they took off to the Demon Fortress...",
    "summary": "Enter the Demon Fortress. Built to torture pesky adventurers, this place is home to great treasure and ghastly creatures alike. But don\u0027t worry, you can count on allies like Fairies and Magical Seagulls to come to your help!\n\nMicro Mages is an homage to NES-era platformers. Being a homebrew NES game itself, it was made completely from scratch. We carefully distilled the spirit of the best games in the system\u0027s library, all the while drawing inspiration from the modern and putting our own spin on things, creating an experience like no other on the NES.",

Those items have to be used in another location to proceed. It is also important to avoid enemies because touching them reduces her life energy, which can be refilled by finding beer bottles.

As a licensed product for the McDonald\u0027s fast food franchise, the game occasionally features the various logos and characters from McDonald\u0027s restaurant signage and television advertisements, for the purposes of plot advancement and power-ups. It stars two children who venture into the fantasy world of McDonaldland in order to return Ronald McDonald\u0027s magical bag, which has been stolen by the Hamburglar. \n \nM.C. Kids was also released for the Commodore 64, Amiga, Atari ST, and MS-DOS, though all of these home computer versions were only sold in Europe.[1] Additionally, a different version of the game was released for the Game Boy, as McDonaldland. This version was released outside of Europe as Spot: The Cool Adventure, themed upon the Cool Spot franchise. Virgin Interactive would release another game based on the McDonald\u0027s franchise for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis called Global Gladiators that is more of a traditional side-scrolling action-adventure game.",

Choose from 4 different classes, each with their own play style. Form your own strategy and defeat any enemies that stand between you and the villainous Koroime. Craft your own weapons and armour to become an over powered champion of the gods.  \n  \nArcher: With a boost in critical hit rate and evade chance, the archer can quickly knock down anyone that steps up to the plate. However, the downfall is the lack of abilities especially early game, this can make your start a struggle.  \n  \nMage: A variety of Margias (Spells) with secondary effects, can make Zana a terrifying foe to battle, with a wide array of attacks, Zana can make battling her frustrating for all enemies involved. Though it\u0027s greatest downfall is the lack of defence, mages can dish it out but they can\u0027t take it.  \n  \nKnight: A great boost in health and defence, Zana as a knight can take any damage given to her, with great health regeneration, the only challenge she\u0027ll face is who is to hit first. Although the knight version of Zana has great health and regen, she doesn\u0027t do as much damage as other classes, so her battles tend to take longer.  \n  \nBrawler: Fast and ruthless the base damage output is the highest, great abilities and powerful attacks, not much needs to be said about the brawler only one question, Who wants these hands first? While the brawler Zana has the highest base damage output, she can\u0027t take many reprisals, low health and defences, but once you start laying in hits, it\u0027s over for the enemy.  \n  \n  \n  \nOnce you have selected your class you are thrown into the world of Skettaria, where you\u0027ll meet new faces and will have the urge to help anyone that asks you for it. The question is though, why were you really brought back? Is it truly to stop one villain? Or is there something greater at hand here?  \n  \nMeet with Lunny, a beautiful hero from one of the world\u0027s most powerful guild, The Heroes Guild. She turned down a job she seemed unfitting for her. It\u0027s up to you to pick up the pieces.  \n  \n  \nCrafting: Through your adventures you\u0027ll pick up items which you can use for crafting for weapons and armour, use them to become an overpowered weapon of the gods.  \n  \nAdventure: There\u0027s a world waiting for you to travel, look around and take it all in, there\u0027s plenty enough to do.  \n  \nFight: what kind of RPG would Second Chance be without fighting enemies!? Battle all kinds of enemies with different strengths and weaknesses.",

    "summary": "Mahjong is a game that originated in China. It is commonly played by four players (with some three-player variations found in South Korea and Japan). Mahjong is a game of skill, strategy, and calculation and involves a degree of chance. The game is played with a set of 144 tiles based on Chinese characters and symbols, although some regional variations use a different number of tiles. In most variations, each player begins by receiving 13 tiles. In turn players draw and discard tiles until they complete a legal hand using the 14th drawn tile to form four groups (melds) and a pair (head). There are fairly standard rules about how a piece is drawn, stolen from another player and thus melded, the use of simples (numbered tiles) and honours (winds and dragons), the kinds of melds, and the order of dealing and play. However there are many regional variations in the rules; in addition, the scoring system and the minimum hand necessary to win varies significantly based on the local rules being used. This game is the digital rendition of Mahjong.",

    "summary": "Shattered Origins is a unique tactical shooter game with elements of strategy, RPG and arcade games. \n \nThe Earth was suffering. Humankind destroyed it almost entirely during the pointless wars and the endless hunt for resources. Life was not possible to sustain anymore. Not on that planet, at least. \n \nAnarchy, struggle and fighting against each other... instead of doing the right thing. That was always the nature of humankind. \n \nThe humans were lucky. They had a savior. A company called \u0027Guardians\u0027 emerged with enough resources to help evacuate most of the population of Earth. They were heroes. A group of the highest military rank joined the Guardian, and formed the \u0027military council\u0027, to supervise all human activities of outer space. \n \nBut humankind had much to learn. \n \nThe first curse was radiation. While humanity was sitting comfortably on Earth, waiting to be saved, they could not even imagine that most of outer space is lethal to human life. They can\u0027t survive certain radiation types, and in the end, they did not dare to explore. They did not go anywhere. They were imprisoned in the few gigantic Star Cruisers of the Guardians. \n \nThen the Guardians claimed that humankind can only survive if they are united, and form the future together. Together, they can be safe. It was a principle that was accepted for a short while, but fanaticism started to slowly take over the Guardian leaders. When they began to see the enemy in everyone, even executing people without much reason, the humans finally started to see what kind of people were controlling them. \n \nThis was the time when more than two million people stole ships from the hangars, and left the Guardian Cruisers far behind. A few million followed in the coming years. \n \nThe Guardians declared these people the \u0027Pirate horde\u0027, and finally, they had a reason to unite. Everyone who remained on the Cruisers became a Guardian, and from then on, the Guardian and Pirate became factions. \n \nHistorians tend to call this separation of human factions \u0027The Shattering\u0027. \n \nTwo hundred years later the Pirate Wars are still devastating, and even on the brink of extinction, humankind keeps on fighting. \n \nAnarchy, struggle and fighting against each other... instead of doing the right thing. That was always the nature of humankind.",

The game was unfortunately never released outside of Japan. The game can be played entirely without looking at the screen, as the point is to listen to the sounds that are emitted from the Game Boy Advance\u0027s speaker. It should be noted, however, that it is quite a challenge to listen to the noises coming from the speaker, and that it\u0027s a lot easier to hook up ear phones or hook the GBA up to a stereo. It will also be very helpful to be in a quiet space.",

Throughout the game your pixel art perspective of the world will be infused with visions of watercolor illustrations that shed some light on your mysterious surroundings. The chiptune soundtrack by Dino Lionetti and Rich Vreeland backs up the aesthetic of the world and sets the mood for strange happenings.",

After weeks of fierce battles and heavy losses, an opportunistic alien force emerges from the depths of space and threatens to take over the solar system - just when humanity is in its weakest and most divided state.  \n \nYou will have to explore and conquer the galaxy as the head of your fleet, planning colonization, terraforming planets, managing your resources and deciding on the appropriate technological research to lead mankind where you want it to go. Research, combined with a top-notch spy network, will enable you to survive in a stellar system which is much more dangerous than it would first appear to be. Who says that space is empty? Black holes, asteroid fields, nebulas, cosmic clouds and wormholes as well as alien races make each fleet sortie a perilous affair. \n \nCan you stand up for the challenge?",

Decide where to locate each unit, and set up appropriate missions for each one. You\u0027ll need to set up defensive patrols to secure the safety of your key sites as well as offensive missions to take out the enemy\u0027s strike capability!\n\nThe Battle of Britain early, in World War II was the first large-scale air war. Continental Europe had fallen to the Nazi Blitzkrieg attacks, and Britain alone remained free and fighting. Without the years of preparation the Germans had, the Royal Air Force had many fewer planes than the Luftwaffe; the outlook was bleak. But with heroic bravery and careful planning, the Spitfires and Hurricanes managed to stave off German bombers for long enough for Britain to survive, and America to join in the fight against tyranny.\n\nNow you can recreate this and many other scenarios. The Battle of Britain showed just how important it is to be master of the skies- are you up to the job?\n\nAir Force Commander: World War Two Edition, is the second game in the Air Force Commander series, and follows the success of the first game, set in the Middle East.",

    "summary": "Your country is at war and as a Captain of a Battleship you must patrol an inner sea to find and destroy aircraft, missiles, ships and submarines. The main playing screen gives you various options and these include three radars, a map screen, status screen and three types of mini-game icons. The three radars are to track either aircraft, ships or submarines and these are represented by a white dot when they are within range. \n \nThe map screen has two maps, one a map of the whole area and the other one showing a closer look at your location. On this screen you can control the speed of your ship and steer it with black dots showing the enemy forces. The status screen shows a profile of your ship and any damage is shown as red and if the whole ship is red then it is damaged and the game is over. \n \nWhen an attack is imminent then a gauge besides one of the mini-game icons turns yellow before turning red and that game can be played. If an aircraft is attacking then the game has you controlling a gun to shoot down the planes viewed from a 1st person perspective. You can move the gun left or right and move it up or down to hit the planes before they drop bombs on your ship. This screen is also used for any missile attack. \n \nIf any convoy\u0027s of ships are attacking then you must fire a missile at the convoy by first lining up a sight that keeps moving while a timer counts down. When the time reaches zero and the sight is red then it will hit a ship but if it doesn\u0027t turn red then you have missed. \n \nThe final game is when a submarine is attacking and the game switches to a 3D side view showing above and below the water. You control a helicopter above the water while the submarine is below. You can move the helicopter left or right, and in and out of the screen. A cursor of the left of the screen moves up and down and when fire is pressed this drops a depth charge which also stops the cursor and this shows the depth your depth charge will explode.",

Leaving Eugene to hold off the Allied onslaught, the Emperor returned to France to work his magic and out of the recruits of France a new army was formed. \n \nMeanwhile, Eugene had fallen back in the face of the larger Allied host. The Prussians walked a diplomatic tight rope for the first months of the year but by March were in open revolt. The Prussian generals formed new forces in East Prussia and Silesia and other parts of the realm. Along with the standing army they were ready to stand with their Russian allies. England helped the Allies with cash and clothing and munitions. The Sixth Coalition was formed to liberate Germany and take the war to France. In the battles to come both sides would be sorely tested to hold their armies together. \n \nCampaign Bautzen allows the players to refight the battles of Lützen and the massive battle of Bautzen, which was the largest land battle fought in Europe up to this time, and many other actions of the Spring Campaign of 1813. Will the Allies pull off a victory against Napoleon or will they succumb to his mastery on the battlefield? \n \nAs a bonus included in this title are the battles of the Russo-Swedish War of 1808-09. Refight the actions in Finland and Sweden which pitted the Russians against their old foes the Swedes. Engage the Swedes in their homeland in the last actions of the war. It\u0027s all there for you to enjoy!",

Most of the time, while exploring the over world, the game is shown in a 2D top-down view. It gives you much freedom: there\u0027s more to do than just stick to the main quest. Towns have a static interface where you reach the wished location by pressing the according symbol. e.g. a church for healing up or a sage for hints. \n \nDuring dungeon crawls the game switches to a 3D view and plays similar to Dungeon Master. As usual for this kind of games you see the dungeon in a small windows while your characters are shown on the right hand side of the screen. Dungeon sequences are completely in real-time. This includes combat which basically consists of clicking on a character\u0027s weapon or magic spell and then clicking on the monster. After every usage of a weapon/spell you have to wait a certain time until you can use it again.",

Whether in a lowly arena on the outskirts of the Empire or in the Colosseum itself, a wide variety of opponents await: heavily armed charioteers, wild bulls, fellow gladiators and more. In a series of battles, from battle royales to one-on-one duels, you must entertain the crowds by spilling blood.\n\nAfter battles, it\u0027s time to train. A series of minigames improves your attributes and your diet perfects your body. Study your rankings, play around with your special skills, and await the next battle.\n\nColosseum: Road to Freedom is a self-described Action RPG, controlled in the third-person and works as a gladiator simulator.",

And so I prepared myself for this day, learning a great many things so I\u0027d be ready to live on my own.\n\nSusuda Prefectoral High School. My new school. Originally, I planned to enter in first year rather than transfer in second year. Life at school is carefree, and even pleasant. Everyone has a great time in class 2-A. There\u0027s just... her, Toe Kurokami. \"Weird\" doesn\u0027t begin to describe her. Always holding that Japanese doll against her chest, never letting go for a second. Some whisper it is a cursed doll, whose hair grows when no one is looking. But it\u0027s just an uncanny doll, with nothing special about it. Yet, perhaps my meeting that girl was fate... No, it was fate.",
