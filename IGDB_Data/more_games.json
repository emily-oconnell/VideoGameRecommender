Well, they went and made one anyway. this is one of those brain melting puzzle games that some will love and some will despise. Each level you are presented with a room with boxes and spots, which are where the boxes should end up. You can push the boxes, but not pull them and you really have to plan in advance to stop getting, um...\u0027boxed\u0027 in. If you feel you\u0027ve taken a bit of a wrong turn, you can simply push a button and rewind your moves. But as well as countless levels of box-shoving there\u0027s also a level editor that allows you to create your own levels of fun and frustration.\n\n(From The PC Engine Software Bible)",

You will be able to play as many different species, even minor ones, from large militaristic empires to isolated nomadic species, or even a pirate faction. The end goals of each faction created, or pre-made can be extremely variable. Sometimes a faction only wants to hide from everyone in their tiny corner of the universe. \n \nOne of the main features is the procedural nature of many important aspects of the game. From characters to star clusters and even the research. This also allows a vast play area where exploration is valued.",

It was made for Ludum Dare 43 (Theme: \"Sacrifices must be made\"). \n \nThe game is made of two parts: a map view, where you can command your group across a procedurally generated world with forests, cities and plains and random encounters: while travelling through the lands, you will randomly encounter friendly or evil people, with whom you can communicate or fight. \n \nAt the moment the game is rather a prototype and we appreciate every feedback we can get. The current version should provide a basic game flow and includes some features that were not finished in time for LudumDare.",

    "summary": "Plot \n \nA hundred years after the arrival of colonists aboard the Snowball 9, planet Eden has become home to half a billion people. In this paradise managed by robots there is not any crime, taxes, unemployment, or freedom. The population lives in a domed \"megapolis,\" and perhaps due to the war that occurred during Return to Eden, there is not any contact between the cities and the surrounding natural world. The occasional sighting of flying saucers keeps the population afraid from going outside. \n \nThe main character, a nameless citizen of Enoch, starts the game in a beautiful garden where everything seems fine. He picks an apple from a tree, a worm pops out, and the player follows it outside the garden, through the desert, and then he awakens. It was only a simulation, one of the many forms of entertainment available during the reign of the third Kim. This \"Garden of Eden as a prison\" allegory sets the mood for the entire game. The objective is to explore the city, and while doing so the player must gather clues to unmask the government conspiracy behind the flying saucers. \nDevelopment \n \nThe Worm in Paradise is the third and final instalment of the Silicon Dreams trilogy and is a departure from the previous games. It \"evolved alongside a 12 month enhancement on Level 9\u0027s own adventure system. Standard features include a 1,000 word vocabulary, a very highly-advanced English input, memory-enhancing text compression, the now familiar and very much appreciated type-ahead, and multi-tasking so a player need never wait while a picture is drawn.\" This was the first game using version 3 of the A-Code system. It was released for four fewer platforms, excluding the Lynx, Memotech MTX, Nascom and Oric-1 compared to the two previous releases. \n \nAnother difference is that the player has only seven days, within the game\u0027s clock, to complete the game. Quests are also time-based and require that the player arrive at certain locations at specific hours to achieve the desired goal. And while game play remains the same, the backdrop is no longer an action adventure, but a political thriller that resembles the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. Similar to what happened when Snowball was released, there was certain confusion about the main character\u0027s identity and the time when the story is set. The Level 9 Fact Sheet says: \"...a couple of years later, Kim Kimberley has become a legend on Eden.\" Another article stated: \"Worm in Paradise is set 100 years later. You are now Kim Kimberley III...\" Furthermore, Pete Austin said, \"Worm is set on Eden, about 50 years in the future\" and \"The player is not Kim - she becomes mayor and runs the place.\" Notice that these sources termed the game by its original name, Worm in Paradise.",

    "storyline": "Sature is a board game of color. The game always pits one player playing against another (or against a computer). Your objective is to darken and dull out your opponent\u0027s colors and end the game with the brighter overall colors. Each player begins the game with a number of hexagonal pieces each with a different color and random number of outward-pointing arrows. Each turn, a colored piece is placed on the board. If a piece is placed on a space with one of the piece\u0027s arrows pointing at a previously placed piece, then the piece being pointed at will change color (and already placed pieces with arrows facing in the correct position will \"retaliate\" against the piece just played). When \"attacked,\" a piece will darken. The greater the color difference between the interacting pieces, the more attacked pieces will darken. A slider at the bottom of the screen indicates which player has the overall brightest colors and is thus winning. There is also a color wheel players can consult at any point during gameplay when strategizing.",
    "summary": "Live the experience of being a painter. Drawing from the process of mixing colors on a palette, Sature offers an engrossing turn-based strategy game. Each turn, players place colored tiles on the board. These tiles mix with neighboring colors to create new tactical situations and opportunities for inventive play. The result is a chess-like dance where players rely on their wits to outmaneuver their opponent. When the board is complete and a game is finished, a unique palette emerges from the way the colors have mixed as they were played on the board.",

In October, the streets are decorated in Halloween decorations in preparation for Kidai Gakuen’s founding festival. \n \nThere is a jewel kept at the school which can grant any wish. Every year at the festival when the ‘orb’ is displayed to the general public, there are many plans to steal it. However, all attempts have been thwarted by voluntary security groups of townspeople and students. Takuto is the leader of one of these groups, who all have special powers bestowed upon them by the jewel’s magic. Together with his trusted friends, he protects the jewel and the festival. \n \nHowever, this year is different. His role as the leader is only a façade; he is only awaiting his chance to steal the jewel for himself. He had planned for this moment for three years, in order to resurrect his late imouto.",

He will come to realize that behind the chaos that is threatening his world lies Seth, the Egyptian god of darkness and evil, who has returned from the kingdom of the dead. \n \nThe hero must therefore undertake an epic journey across the various epochs and myths. He will fight a multitude of monsters of all shapes and sizes, and even overthrow a few gods, on his way to preventing Seth establish his wicked reign. \n \nAn epic adventure across four great mythologies - Aztec, Egyptian, Greek and Norse - allowing the player to live through many of the key episodes that mark these cultures (the siege of Troy, Ragnarok, ......) and setting him in the path of the most prominent figures within each episode (Achilles, Thor, Akhenaton...). \n \nChoose from four different heroes with radically different attributes and powers. Each hero has a vast array of spells and skills to help him through his quest. \n \nInnumerable story lines through random generation of decors and items, so that nobody lives the same experience and allowing the game to be played many times without the hero ever having the same set of weapons, armour or spells.",

    "storyline": "Centuries ago, a brutal beast of destruction rent the world asunder. In this time of need, the first Immortals came into their uncanny powers, powers so great that they succeeded in destroying the beast ravaging the land, where all else had failed.\n\nTo prevent such destruction from ever happening again, the Immortals banded together to form a Council that would enforce order and stability on a global scale, stepping in at any hint of war or chaos.\n\nThe Immortals might be vastly powerful, but they are few. Even they can\u0027t oversee all of the lands. This is why they rely upon their mortal agents, the Arbiters, to guard the land\u0027s people from the more day-to-day dangers they face. Arbiters range over the land, rooting out bandits, unruly monsters, and crooked officials; their word is law.\n\nBut one Arbiter uncovers the deepening corruption pervading her own order, and it falls to her to halt the spread of a threat as dire as the brutal beast of yore.",
    "summary": "Fell Seal: Arbiter\u0027s Mark is a story-driven, turn-based tactical RPG set in a fantasy world with a touch of steampunk. Take control of the Arbiter Kyrie, an agent of the Immortal Council tasked with preserving stability and order throughout the land, and lead your troops through difficult encounters.\n\nExperience an epic and mature story, unfolding through over 40 story encounters and topped with challenging end-game content.\n\nClassic tactical combat battles, with rugged terrain and elevation, taking place on beautiful hand-drawn environments.\n\nA deep and complex class system with over 30 classes and 300 abilities lets you truly customize every one of your characters through the selection of their class, sub-class and passives.

    "summary": "After the decisive Battle of Leipzig the French retreated to the Rhine and beyond into France. Following them were the victorious forces of the Sixth Coalition. Napoleon positioned his forces on the Rhine, in Holland and in Belgium and then left for Paris to build new field commands. Eugene was in northern Italy facing an Austrian army under Bellegarde. And of course the war in Spain was winding down. \n \nThe Allies did not wait for Napoleon to bring up his new army and began to cross the Rhine at several points. The understrength French corps were no match for the Allied juggernaut and retired by stages closer to the west. By the end of January the Allies had advanced to within one hundred miles of Paris! \n \nWhat followed from that point, until the end of the campaign, was one of Napoleon\u0027s most remarkable campaigns. Fielding an army one third the size of the Allied forces he won one stunning victory after another. Unfortunately he was never able to achieve a decisive victory. The Allied armies gradually ground down the outnumbered French forces and after the Battle of Paris he was forced to abdicate. \n \nAs either Napoleon, Emperor of the French and King of Italy, or as Schwarzenberg and Blücher, field commanders of the Allied legions, you can relive those exciting days! With over four hundred scenarios, and more than ten campaigns, all of the major actions of the 1814 Campaign in northwest France are covered in detail. Units such as the Gendarmes d\u0027Espanol and the Baden Guard Grenadiers have been added to the 1813-14 inventory for the players to command. \n \nCome experience the drama of the campaign as your men shiver in the cold waiting for your next command. Will you, as Napoleon, keep your throne, or will you as the Allied commanders, march victoriously into Paris? The choice is yours as you ride off into destiny!",

    "summary": "Backbreaker is an American football video game, developed by British technology developer NaturalMotion, and released on 1 June 2010 in North America and on 25 June 2010 in Europe. One of its highlights is the use of Euphoria, a game animation engine that determines animations dynamically rather than depending on canned animations. Backbreaker does not use teams from the National Football League (NFL) because Electronic Arts has an exclusive license to produce NFL games in its Madden series. The game relies on an extensive logo editor and team builder that was called \"one of its silver linings\". NaturalMotion announced Backbreaker in August 2007, with a targeted release date of late 2008. The game ended up being delayed until mid-2010. \n \nBackbreaker received mixed reviews. While it was praised for the Euphoria animation system, realistic physical gameplay, and the logo editor, it was also criticized for its weak online play, poor passing game, and lack of depth in single-player modes. After the reviews, the passing game was adjusted by the greathouse patch. The Xbox 360 version of the game received an overall rating of 54% from review aggregator Metacritic, while the PlayStation 3 version received a 58%. The iOS and Android version was given a rating of 4.5 out of 5 stars by Touch Arcade. A patch released on 6 August 2010, alleviated many of the issues critics had with the game upon release and included upgrades such as: improved AI, new play books and an enhanced replay feature.[1]",

    "summary": "During the Bunkyuu Era, the Tokugawa shogunate that had remained in power for three centuries was being pressured by both foreign countries to open its borders and feudal lords who aspired to restore Imperial rule, and was on the verge of collapse due to internal and external scheming.\n\nThe political strife shifted from Edo to Kyoto, with heroes and conspirators alike attracted to the Imperial capital. At that time, a new squad called Shinsengumi was formed on the orders of the Military Commissioner Matsudaira Katamori to maintain peace and order. Only women known as \"shouki\", who can harness power of mystical stones known as \"kishouseki\", were eligible to become its members.\n\nOkita Soujirou was working as an instructor at the Shieikan dojo in western Edo. Without any relatives, he considered the dojo master Kondou Isa and her sworn sister Hijikata Sei, who both saved his life when he was young, to be his family. When women of the dojo were called to help in forming the Shinsengumi, they asked Soujirou to disguise himself as a woman and join them. Now known as Okita Soushi, Soujirou held only one goal in him mind - to protect Isa and Sei, even if he couldn\u0027t hold the same power as a real \"shouki\".",

Each team may discuss and is allowed one guess per turn. The team who wins the goal is on step closer to conquering time. There are three types of game modes: Fast, Regular and Legend. In Fast mode, players compete for the best out of three missions, in Regular, for the best out of five of missions, and in Legend for the best out of seven missions.",

    "storyline": "The third part opens with the Nameless Hero and his friends sailing to a new continent overrun with orcs, arriving in the Myrtana, the central region of the continent. The hero lost all his stuff from the previous game when his ship is stolen while he\u0027s onshore with Milten, Diego, Gorn, and Lester. Presumably this is the source of the orc invasion that was launched on Khorinis during the second chapter. These lands have no physical connection to Khorinis or the ruins of the penal colony. In these mountainous forests the orcs have enslaved the human kingdom with only a few free humans living in the nearly uninhabitable icy northlands of Nordmar and the southern desert of Varant. The hero must decide whether to join the rebellion and stay true to the deposed human king, serve the Orcish usurpers in their quest to topple the last remaining human stronghold, or choose a path that serves his own ends. Throughout the story, he is accompanied by a number of NPCs, some of whom are old friends. While this chapter brings forward friends from the previous title (Xardas, Diego, Milten, Gorn, Lester, Lee, and Vatras) it also introduces two new major characters; King Rhobar the Second (who ultimately was responsible for sending the Nameless Hero to the penal colony in the first game) and Zuben. While the king has a strong past as a bold leader, he now faces a near defeat; his fame on the decline. Zuben leads the Hashishin that inhabit the southern region of Varant.",

    "summary": "Black Jack - Daily 21 points, supports Insurance, \"Straight Flush\" and \"Five Dragon\" inside.\n\nBlackjack, also known as twenty-one, is the most widely played casino banking game in the world.[1] Blackjack is a comparing card game between a player and dealer and played with one or more decks of 52 cards.\n\nThe player or players are dealt an initial two card hand and add the total of their cards. Face cards (Kings, Queens, and Jacks) are counted as ten points. The player and dealer can count their own Ace as 1-point or 11 points. All other cards are counted as the numeric value shown on the card. After receiving their initial two cards, players have the option of getting a \"hit\" (taking additional cards) to bring their total value of cards to 21 points, or as close as possible without exceeding 21 (called \"busting\"). If a player holds an ace valued as 11, the hand is called \"soft\", meaning that the player cannot go bust by taking an additional card; otherwise, the hand is \"hard\".\n\nThe dealer has to take hits until his cards total 17 or more points. (In some casinos, the dealer also hits on a \"soft\" 17, e.g. initial ace and six.) Players who do not bust and have a total higher than the dealer, win. The dealer will lose if he or she busts, or has a lesser hand than the player who has not busted. If the player and dealer have the same point total, this is called a \"push\" and the player typically doesn\u0027t win or lose money on that hand.\n\nMany rule variations of blackjack exist. Since the 1960\u0027s, blackjack has been a high profile target of advantage players, particularly card counters, who track the profile of cards that have been dealt and adapt their wager and playing strategies accordingly.\n\nOther casino games inspired by blackjack include Spanish 21 and pontoon. The recreational British card game of black jack is a shedding-type game and unrelated to the subject of this article.",
