What followed was a blitzkrieg campaign that caught the Austrians completely by surprise. The French army rolled on to the east to take Milan and then turn south and west to fight the Austrian army at Piacenza, Casteggio and then Marengo, the final battle of the campaign. Bonaparte\u0027s fame was secure and by 1804 he would be crowned the Emperor of France. \n \nCampaign Marengo covers the battles and campaigns in Northern Italy from 1795 through 1800 and allows the players to refight the famous battles of these campaigns. Three campaign files cover the major campaigns while three shorter ones cover the various operations in 1796 to resupply Mantua and defeat Bonaparte and the French in battle. \n \nRelive the days of Suvorov\u0027s Russian army marching onto the fields of battle alongside their Austrian allies. As the commander of the French army in 1796, lead your men on to victory on the fields of Castiglione, Rivoli, Arcole and the other battles around Verona. As Massena, lead the French to victory at Loano in 1795. Campaign Marengo offers all this and more!",

The game is the logical extension of Tetris into the third dimension. In Tetris, the player manipulates a set of tetrominoes which fall into a two-dimensional pit (seen from the side). The aim is to solve a real-time packing problem by forming complete rows, which then disappear and score points. Poor play leads to incomplete rows, caused by inefficient arrangements of tiles; these rows do not disappear, giving the player progressively less space and less time to play subsequent pieces. \n\nSimilarly, in Blockout, the player manipulates a set of polycubes which fall into a three-dimensional pit (seen from above; the pieces appear in the foreground and fall away). The pieces can be rotated around all three axes, and moved horizontally and vertically. The aim is to form complete layers.",

    "summary": "A new entry in the Vandal Hearts series, Flames of Judgement follows the story of young orphan Tobias Martin as he bands together with his schoolmates to help defend his homeland against a rival kingdom. The story acts as a prequel to the original Vandal Hearts. \n \nThe series\u0027 trademark isometric combat returns, now presented in 3-D with 3-D character models. Players attempt to position themselves tactically to gain an advantage over stronger (or more numerous) foes. Combat takes place in turns, with each side moving one character per turn. Each party member can carry two weapons and switch between them without using up a \"turn,\" allowing them to shift quickly from a sword to a long-range bow, for example. Characters gain levels through successful battles, and increase skills with a particular weapon or spell by using that weapon or spell in combat. \n \nMany engagements expand beyond simple combat by introducing some sort of puzzle element, ranging from pushing boulders to protecting characters from attackers. Missions may also radically update their goals as progress is made. In addition to the standard game, there are also multiple endings and multiple \"secret maps\" unlocked across the regular levels.",

You are a spikey-headed cyber-shield guy (with a cyber-shield) trying to block \"perplexing 3D geometric attacks\" that come flipping toward you. If you hit them, they bounce back. The object of the game is to try to hit Vector Strong Bad\u0027s head until it disappears. The game\u0027s graphical style appears to be a reference to Nintendo\u0027s ill-fated 3D system, the Virtual Boy. The graphics of the console were well-known for solely consisting of the colors red and black, much like those in StrongBadZone. In particular, the game stylistically resembles the Virtual Boy vector game Red Alarm, which at one point also features a large face that must be destroyed.",

Except as Lila (now promoted to Lieutenant) points out in the intro, why send in the Supernatural SWAT squad to deal with common terrorists? As the Chief reveals, they\u0027ve found strange creatures in sewers - creatures not of this world, but from Hades (the other dimension in the first game), meaning whoever was behind the previous crisis is behind this one. What survivors remain are barricading themselves indoors. The city has been cordoned off and Lila is the prime candidate for the mission. So off she sets, with four fellow S-SWAT members, to regain control. \n \nThis sequel has undergone radical changes from the original, with all of the RPG trappings stripped out. There\u0027s no longer any kind of stats, menu system to navigate, day/night cycle, overworld map, or weapon recovery items. In fact the only items are drugs, which restore health to maximum and only one can be carried at a time, and key items with further the story. The biggest (and arguably best) change is the combat: there are no longer any random battles. Taking place on a series of massively sprawling maps, as opposed to shrunken JRPG-style maps which warp you to new maps when entering buildings, all enemies can be seen immediately. Furthermore you never fight more than a single enemy at a time. If there\u0027s something hostile in a new area, you can see his health bar at the bottom. \n \nIn a lot of ways it closely resembles the original Metal Gear, except more sedate and with greater emphasis on NPC dialogue.",

There is no strict approval process also. Detectives are very much like ordinary people. They don\u0027t have any special authority for investigations per say. So for example, when a detective ask someone about something or they ask for a survey or when they are on a stakeout, they may be mistaken as a stalker or suspicious person. This means they might be reported to the police. Since this is the case, Japanese detectives should be quick on their feet and should be able to lie and make good excuses on the spot.\nI was originally a good person who was very bad at lying, but during my detective work over the past 10 years, I had become a good liar and deceiver. This is a detective adventure game made by someone who is good at deceiving people.",

As with its predecessor, Scramble Wars, the game is a tactical turn-based war simulation in which each side uses their Gundam mechas to defeat the other and are occasionally aided by a \"gachapon\" - or capsule machine - that dispenses additional Gundams in a manner similar to their toy counterparts.\n\nThe game was the first of the series to be released on a Famicom cart, as Scramble Wars was a Famicom Disk System-only game. Capsule Senki was also rereleased on the Japanese Wii Shop\u0027s Virtual Console.",

Hard and thick skin, bristle like an animal, thick fingers and sharp nails, it was not a human\u0027s hand. Also, there was a jewel ring on the ring finger.\n\nThis mysterious story was featured in a magazine and caught people\u0027s attention. Days later, the police found that it was a woman\u0027s hand, who had been missing for a month. She went missing when she played golf with her friends nearby. The police confirmed she was attacked by a stray dog, but couldn\u0027t explain why the hand looked so differently. They tried to close the case, but her husband wasn\u0027t convinced. He didn\u0027t want to believe his wife was a monster. He decided to ask a detective to investigate the case, that\u0027s why Kouya is now roaming around deep inside the forest.\n\nIt is getting dark, but he doesn\u0027t know where he is now. Just when he feels dizzy, he hears someone\u0027s voice. Is that auditory hallucination? He hears a girl\u0027s voice this time. \"I\u0027ve been saved!\" But he accidentally falls down a waterfall. When he regains his consciousness, he finds himself lying in the bed. He looks around and finds three girls. \"Are you alright?\" \"Well, did you save me?\" \"Yes, I and my older sister carried you all the way here.\" Their mother says to him, \"I\u0027m relieved to see you getting well. But you must marry either of my daughters, Sunao or Hiori.\"\n\nHe doesn\u0027t know what she means. A mysterious hand bitten off by someone, a small village deep inside the forest, marriage to a miko, Kouya\u0027s fate is led to unexpected direction after he meets these two girls...",

The main character of the game, very remotely resembling a brave sailor from York, ends up on an island with almost nothing. The player will have to experience all the delights of being a city dweller on an uninhabited island - to solve the pressing problems of everyday life (finding fresh water and food, fishing and meeting with a crocodile, making fire and building a house), communicating with the natives and visiting an abandoned ship. And when it turns out that the island is not completely uninhabited, save the future friend and comrade-in-arms (Friday, who, by the way, has yet to learn Russian) and try to flee by building a balloon out of improvised means and outwitting the pirates. And the fate of the poor fellow Robinson depends on the acumen of the player. Unlike most of the existing adventure games, the main character can influence each of the selected items on any active object on the screen, which makes the passing of the game much more diverse. \"New Robinson\" also includes many ingenious plug-in games.",

Very little of the manor has survived the holocaust ignited when the Detective disabled Charles Dalimar\u0027s immortality machine, but Emma Ravenhearst\u0027s ghost appears to him, warning him away, but promising to help if he proceeds.\nAfter inspecting the ruins as far as a nearby lighthouse and the back garden, the Master Detective is flung into an open grave bearing his (or her) own name by Victor Dalimar. After encountering Charles, the Master Detective sets to work on a steampunk recreation of scenes in Charles\u0027 insane life, which the Detective must now relive by solving one puzzle after another. Arriving in an underground antechamber, the Master Detective must watch as the four souls previously rescued from the manor: Emma, Rose Somerset, and her twin daughters Charlotte and Gwendolyn are re-imprisoned, and restored to living humans as each scene opens. The Detective must participate in recreating Charles\u0027s birth, abusive childhood, time of commitment to a mental institution, and the wedding he planned for himself and Emma.\nOnce the Detective has traveled through Charles\u0027s world, the final door opens (via Emma\u0027s chamber) to reveal a rudimentary mansion with a new immortality machine, powered by the life-forces of the kidnapped citizens of Blackpool. Sneaking past a jubilant Charles and Victor, the Master Detective deciphers clues from the enslaved prisoners to figure out how to shut down the machine, freeing Emma, Rose, Gwendolyn, and Charlotte and destroying the Dalimars once and for all.",

Walking forward (from prairie to swamp, fern room to seasonal flowers), the world unfolds linearly, along a garden path, at whatever pace one may choose.",

Its main focus is retelling the events of Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil CODE:Veronica, with a third act which ties the two together. For the Resident Evil 2 segment, the player takes control of protagonists Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield, with Sherry Birkin acting as an escort character in one chapter. The CODE: Veronica chapter features Claire, accompanied by fellow Rockfort Island prisoner Steve Burnside, and later her brother Chris Redfield.",
    "summary": "Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles is an on-rails shooting game. In the Resident Evil series it is the second title exclusive to the Wii platform. The game\u0027s plot revolves around the personal stories and tragedies in the series, with its main focus on retelling the events of Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil: Code: Veronica.  \n  \nA new chapter called Operation Javier fleshes out the plot further and explains the motives of Resident Evil 4 villain Jack Krauser. It takes place in 2002 and is set in the waterside village of Mixcoatl, located in the South American Amparo. It tells the story of Leon S. Kennedy teaming up with Jack Krauser to investigate the connections of crime lord Javier Hidalgo to a former Umbrella researcher.  \n  \nJust like The Umbrella Chronicles players do not control the character\u0027s movement, but only the shooting aspect, shown from a first-person perspective. The player\u0027s partner is also shown on the screen and there is an cooperative option for two players.",

On each static screen, the player is free to look around 360o. The game\u0027s interface is very simple; there is no HUD, instead the player has access to an inventory in which all items are stored. From the inventory, the player can also access objectives, review dialogue and examine any documents they have acquired.[9] \n \nTo speak to people or interact with objects, the player must click on them with the pointer. As the player moves the pointer around the screen it can change to an arrow (meaning the player can move in that direction), a magnifying glass (meaning the player can inspect something in more detail), a cog with a red line through it (meaning the player must use an item on the object), a cog without a red line (meaning the player can operate the object without using an item) or a hand (meaning the player can pick the item up). When the player clicks on a person to whom they wish to speak, a list of conversation topics appear on screen. When the player picks up an item, it is automatically put into an auto-holder rather than the main inventory, and must be transferred manually from the auto-holder to the inventory screen. This allows the player to sort the inventory in any way they wish.",

That, along with the tendency of craps players to have several bets working at once, means that craps requires a larger bankroll than other table games.

The player controls the titular character through six stages of increasing difficulty, facing an alien \"governor\" boss (which are so large as to be considered levels in and of themselves, as some of the bosses take up several screens) at the end of each level, followed by a \"duel\" level against other Robo-Kid sized robots. Many levels branch into others, giving the player the choice over which zone to enter next, increasing replayability.",

It was released on November 19, 2007 for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3. \n \nThe cover features Greg Oden, formerly of the Ohio State Buckeyes. \n \nAlmost every school competing in Division I NCAA college basketball at the time was included in 2K8, including recent additions South Carolina-Upstate, Cal State-Bakersfield and Florida Gulf Coast. Not included were Presbyterian College and North Carolina Central, D-1 independents. Also, Centenary College of the Summit League was unlicensed and instead named UL-Calcutta. The game also featured the ability to change and modify rosters and share them online via the newly introduced 2K Share feature. The real coaches feature was dropped from this game, possibly because the coaches chose not to renew their contracts and all of the coaches are unnamed. \n \nThe announcers/commentators featured in the game were Verne Lundquist and Bill Raftery. The College Hoops series was put on hiatus in 2008 as 2K Sports declined to seek the college license for a 2K9 release. EA Sports got the contract before 2K did, so EA will continue to make college basketball games. EA discontinued their college basketball game series in 2010. It is currently unknown if 2K Sports will continue to make their College Hoops 2K series.",

Fixed fleets, doesn\u0027t include building of units or resource management mechanics. \n \nShips are made of and entirely defined by their modules. The modules such as generators, thrusters, weapons, armor etc. form the structure and define the behavior of the ship. Ships can have anywhere between 5 to over 1000 modules. \n \nShip and level editor. You can not only create new ship designs and battle challenges but edit all existing ones using in-game editors. \n \nNo-cheating Newtonian physics. All movement is driven by forces from thrusters and other actuators, and there is no friction or dampening. Ships and other objects are simulated as rigid bodies with accurate collision geometries and inertia. \n \nPer-module damage model. Ships can get partially disabled and split in two. The damage model also includes armor penetration and ricochet calculations. \n \nShip resource system. Most modules have a single function such as power generation or heat dissipation. The resource system gathers, stores and distributes resources such as electricity, heat and fuel between modules on every frame.",

M.I.A. can be played by up to two players, with Player 1 in green and Player 2 in blue. \n \nThroughout most of the game, the player\u0027s main weapon is a knife, which is capable of destroying any enemy in the game. By killing the red enemy soldiers, the player can acquire additional weapons. The available weapons consist of an assault rifle (12 rounds), a flamethrower (2 rounds), a bazooka (3 rounds), and grenades (3 rounds). Unlike Green Beret, the player can carry more than one weapon and switch between them at will. If the player loses a life, then only their currently equipped weapon will be lost. \n \nAt the end of each level, an assorted amount of troops on fixed machine gun positions (usually four) that must be eliminated. On the last mission of the game, the freed hostages are susceptible to being slain by enemies; if all the POW\u0027s get killed then \"MISSION FAILED\" flashes on the screen and the game is permanently over.",

    "storyline": "The Himalayas, 1600 CE \n \nYou are Ananta, a 68 year old woman. Suffering recently from cataracts and arthritis, and for much longer from the hardships of life, you have begun to long for release. \n \nBut is there such a thing? With death in the doorway you know rebirth will follow, and rebirth is not release…. So you flee death in search of escape, and find a forgotten valley where a talking fox offers his guidance. But will he really help, or is he using you for his own agenda?",
    "summary": "The Wild Eternal is a first-person adventure game about an old woman who wishes not to be reborn, and a talkative fox who offers to help her. As the old woman, players will explore beautifully hand-crafted non-linear levels while traveling from clear vistas (where they\u0027ll spot distant landmarks) into foggy valleys (where they\u0027ll get lost trying to get to those distant landmarks), collecting keys, tribute, and blessings along the way. Tranquil moments will offer story bits from the fox, while mundane and strange wildlife present unique and unknown obstacles on the journey toward liberation. \n \nIn The Wild Eternal, venture from clear vistas into the foggy unknown on your journey toward eternal liberation. \n \n- Collect a God\u0027s crystalline tears and unlock expansive new areas. \n- Come face to face with wild and mythic critters. \n- Converse extensively with your fox guide about whatever he feels like. \n- Find tribute and offer them to shrines for powerful blessings. \n- Unravel the mysteries of a magical world long deserted by its powerful caretakers.",

As the knight, wander the maze-like structure looking for gold and defeating enemies. \n \nJut like in the classic puzzle game Tetris, creating a full row of tiles will make them disappear. And that includes whatever was inside them! So be careful not to place your knight inside a line that is being cleared! \n \nThe goal of this prototype version of the game is to collect as much loot and level up by defeating the enemies before the map gets filled to the top. When that happens, a portal will appear. Reaching it will mean victory. \n \nGetting stuck with no way out is not uncommon inside a dungeon. Luckily for you, the knight is very resourceful and can use different tools to help him during the exploration: \n- Hammers can create a tile of walkable ground in front of you \n- Pickaxes let you break walls \n- Bombs let you destroy tiles (this can be helpful to fit rooms together)",
