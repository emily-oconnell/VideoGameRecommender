    "storyline": "In \"Don\u0027t Go Bang!\" for PC, every decision matters. The terrorist cell, Fraction, is unforgiving, and it\u0027s reflected in the game with permadeath and autosaves to make going back on decisions impossible. You\u0027ll have to make difficult choices every day as the Commander of the UOD - but remember your ultimate goal is to protect civilians and to prevent panic and terror.\n\nYou can\u0027t do it alone. Using your limited funds, you must continually recruit and manage your team of professional bomb disposal experts, teach them to grow their skills, and to monitor channels and the map for suspicious activity.\n\n\nHire Screen\nYour team can get injured, get mentally stressed or ill, they can act erratically with other team members, they can lose their skills over time, and most importantly they can save the city. But it\u0027s up to you to manage which one can happen at any given time. Your team must gather Intel which can prevent terror attacks on and around the city, and allow you to send yourself or your team out on missions to diffuse bombs or arrest suspicious individuals in order to eradicate  the terrorist cell, Fraction, from the city.\n\nWho Are Fraction?\n \n\nFraction is a terrorist cell whose base of operation is somewhere within the city you reside over. They are made up of teams of hackers, bomb makers, and general anarchists whom have all come to the conclusion that in order to resolve issues of inequality and overpopulation, a vast majority of the population must be eradicated in order for humanity to continue at a diminished rate.\n\nThey see no other alternative, and while they originally set out to disrupt the accumulation of wealth for the richest 1%, they have slowly changed their doctrine to encumber more extremist measures, killing indiscriminately in order to incite fear and ultimately reduce the population down to a fraction of what it once was.\n\nFinding Fraction and Their Threats:\n\nAs your team gather Intel, you\u0027ll be able to pinpoint locations of interest, such as where Fractions Members meet, where they assemble bombs, and most immediately pressing, where they have planted a bomb.\n\nA Single District of the Map\nThe map consists of many districts, each with their own attributes, landmarks, municipals buildings, functions, and classes. This determines whether or not they are likely to be under immediate threat by Fraction, as the terrorist cell adopts a different tactic every other week to disrupt your operations, and eliminate human life.\n\nFor instance, as Fraction was founded upon disrupting the lives of the socially elite, they may initially still target richer districts at first. However, their tactics have grown so indiscriminate over time, that no where is safe.\n\nStory Building:\n\nIn \"Don\u0027t Go Bang!\" concerned citizens and members of UOD will email you regularly about the state of the city, and the state of your management skills. This is the primary way you directly build relationships in the game, with each email having multiple responses to cater to your own style of management, and your own intentions for how your relationship develops with that person. There is no \"Just Good\" or \"Just Bad\" answer. We want to embrace the grey area of dealing with a complex and frightening scenario.\n\nEmail System\nAs you build relationships, the content of each email differs as every person remembers who you are and what you\u0027ve said. Choose to be unkind because you don\u0027t have the time, and it might come back to bite you later. Equally, be too soft and people might find it acceptable to walk all over you. Remember, YOU are in charge.\n\nUltimately, you are responsible for the protection of the city. As such, if you continue to fail on a regular basis, you will be petitioned to be replaced by the citizens of the city, as they work themselves into a panic and a frenzy. They will make life continually more difficult for you. If they succeed in having you removed from office, the game, and the city, is lost.\n\nDo not fail them. Do not fail your loved ones. Do not let Fraction win.\n\n\n\nCurrent Features: (In The Mobile Game)\n\nProcedural Bomb Generation\nWire Cutting Puzzle Variations (Cut All Yellow Wires, Cut Third Wires etc.)\nMultiple Tiers Per Bomb (Multiple Levels/Sections to each bomb.)\nPlanned Features: (For The PC Game)\n\nMassively improved visuals - We\u0027ll be able to hire an artist better than ourselves to give the games art a complete overhaul to capture the intensity of the situation, whilst still capturing the games dark humour moments too.\nPanic - The purpose of the game is to respond to terrorist threats, suspected/potential/otherwise. Failure to do so will result in increased panic in the city, and as this grows the citizens can petition to have your funds lowered, or to have you removed completely, resulting in Game Over.\nComplex Bomb Disposal - With the limitation of a single tap used in mobile games being lifted, we can make the bomb disposal process much more complex and interesting. This includes requiring certain tools to perform certain actions.\nRules/Instructions - The rules of bomb disposal will change depending on how quickly Fraction is improving their bomb making skills. It\u0027s upto your team to gather Intel to give you the new list of instructions as quickly as possible. E.g. You may be told to always cut the first red wire, and then one day that rules changes...\nFull Map - A huge interactive Map with different districts that have different functions for the city. As events/festivals/celebrations come up, the population density of an area may change, and you\u0027ll have to work harder to protect these areas.\nManage and Build your team - Hire people you trust and build them up to be the best they can be at bomb disposal. You cannot afford to use them sparingly, but be careful as once they\u0027re dead, they stay dead.\nConnection to the Citizens - You receive regular emails and communications from concerned or supportive citizens in the city regarding the recent events. You can make dialogue decisions on how well you should inform the public or build relationships with people. Be careful though, as you fail missions, those you care about can perish.\nShop - You are able to customise your office space that you work in, as well as buy new equipment for yourself and your crew.\nResearch - As Fraction grows, and their bomb making prowess increases, it’s your job to stay one step ahead, so you’d have to recruit avid researchers to provide you with the latest tools and equipment to deal with the threats.\nScanner/Send Investigation Team – As briefly mentioned, the map displays information about the city currently, but in order to find bombs there has to be a process to do so. You can do this by scanning for suspicious signals, or physically sending an investigation team (at your expense) to reconnoitre the area and report back if there are threats or potential threats.\n\n\nBreakdown of Funds for Don\u0027t Go Bang!\nPart of our commitment to being open and honest regarding everything about this endeavour means going over exactly where your pledges will be going towards. On our part, we\u0027ve designed the game for a long time, and came up with exactly what it is and could be back when it was a mobile game, and what it is now! \nAs such, you might be wondering while Design gets less of a cut than Art and Programming, but the truth is we did a lot of the Design work off our own funds, but it still needs Playtesting which comes under Design, and also various tweaks - a lot of the time a Programmer makes it work, but a Designer makes it feel right. Equally, while the Writing Budget is low, it\u0027s because this also comes under Design at times, so it\u0027s actually difficult to pinpoint.\n\n\n We\u0027ll be humbled immensely if we reach our goal of £20,000, but if the unimaginable were to happen and we go beyond that, we\u0027ve carefully selected a number of stretch goals to help make \"Don\u0027t Go Bang!\" an even better experience.\n\n\nStretch Goals for Don\u0027t Go Bang!\nEither way, we\u0027ll strive to make \"Don\u0027t Go Bang!\" an amazing experience, with incredible gameplay and an engaging, unforgettable story.",
    "summary": "Don\u0027t Go Bang is the first full PC title brought to you by Dalriada Games. In this ambitious real-time strategy experience you assume the control of the UOD (Unstable Ordinance Disposal). A division tasked with the uncovering and defusing of explosives planted by the infamous terrorist cell known as \"Fraction\". You command an elite team of specialists, each with their own unique skills, abilities, and personalities. You must monitor the maps and gain information from your expert intel team to find bomb locations, and discover Fractions ultimate plans.\n\nYou are the last protector of a city strewn by chaos and terror. Don\u0027t let \u0027em down sir.\n\nIn Don\u0027t Go Bang! for PC, every decision matters. The terrorist cell, Fraction, is unforgiving, and it\u0027s reflected in the game with permadeath and autosaves to make going back on decisions impossible. You\u0027ll have to make difficult choices every day as the Commander of the UOD - but remember your ultimate goal is to protect civilians and to prevent panic and terror.\n\nYou can\u0027t do it alone. Using your limited funds, you must continually recruit and manage your team of professional bomb disposal experts, teach them to grow their skills, and to monitor channels and the map for suspicious activity.",

After selecting the preferred riding style between Basic, Arcade, Advanced, Simulation and Extreme, it\u0027s possible to adapt the game to each own needs: braking assistance, power braking, front and rear braking at once or separate control, traction control, advanced physics, off track stability control, rider\u0027s health, bike damages, tire wear, starting help, automatic transmission, rider position control, official rules, warm up lap, false start penalty, ideal trajectory, riding help. \n \nWhen selecting the Simulation riding model there are many things that need to be taken into consideration: tires wear down, brakes can wear down, the bike can be damaged and the rider can be injured when an accident occurs. It\u0027s therefore important to find the best setup for the bike changing suspension setup, handling geometry, braking, chainring length, gear ratio and tire type.",

Acclaim\u0027s Mountain View, California-based coin-op division went out of business shortly after creating the game, so it never went into full production. GamePro reported that Armageddon was shown to their editors behind the scenes at the 1997 ASI show in Las Vegas, but did not appear on the show floor.The arcade board used 3dfx components and included 600 MB of RAM. \n \nGameplay is a cross between real time combat and strategy, with characters representing one of the five colors. White had healing and soldiers; Blue countermagic and water creatures; Black death and undead creatures; Red fire and mountain creatures; and Green elves and forest magic. The game was controlled with a trackball, and supported up to two players. Players could summon creatures to the arena as well as attack the opposing wizard directly",

With their greedy eyes on RollerGames\u0027 mega prize money, they\u0027ve corrupted three teams and kidnapped Emerson \"Skeeter\" Bankhead, the games\u0027 beloved commissioner. \nYou and your own three teams of righteous skate kings must stop V.I.P.E.R.\u0027s criminal venom from infecting the entire city. So you\u0027ve got to take the fight to the streets. And the sewers, and the junkyards, and the highways and the jungles . . . through six stages of dastardly traps of doom as you leap over open manholes, careening oil drums and treacherous land-slides. Race around oil slicks and man-eating canines. And avoid ambush by combat copters, bomb-wielding goons and creeps like Captain Meat Hook and the Fish Face. But time is against you. And so are V.I.P.E.R.\u0027s judo masters, skateboard thugs, motorcycle madmen and other assorted sinister scum. \nIf your multi-faceted fists can\u0027t punch you through, you\u0027ll need your special assault body blocks, jump kicks and double whammy slams. \nIt\u0027s a bone-crunching skate-athon for your life, Skeeter\u0027s life, and for the good of RollerGames™. So vanquish V.I.P.E.R. before they melt your ball bearings into bullets.",

So, they left messages for later generations in the form of indestructible message plates written in ancient Hebrew, informing them that if they could not find a good use for their creations, they should be destroyed. \n \nVarious paramilitaries, national armies, and armed private forces began to secretly search for these \"mysterious artifacts\" in order to be used for their own good and against their enemies. The ARCAM Corporation and their military arm, the ARCAM Private Army, can stop these forces from destroying themselves with their elite secret agents known as Spriggans.",

    "storyline": "\"It has been two months since the Kantou Incident—the name given to Angelia Avalon’s failed attempt to punch through the walls between dimensions in the Kantou region of Japan. \n \nDuring the Incident, the Drexler Institute—an organization with ties to demons—began to stir, re-activating various projects in different parts of the world. The Japanese branch of the Drexler Institute was annihilated by the European Celestial Union, but found new life as the Rosenberg Branch of the European Celestial Union. \n \nSoon after the Kantou Incident, large-scale dimensional rifts began to open all across Japan. This sudden uptick in celestial phenomena was seen as exceptionally odd by many, and some even whispered that it could be the result of secret research by the Drexler Institute. The Japanese branch of the Celestial Union was dispatched to investigate the phenomena, and they called on several angels from the National Academy of Metaphysics. \n \nSeveral angels from the Rosenberg Branch of the Celestial Union were also dispatched, but they were soon intercepted by the Aesir. \n \nOnly six days remain until the destruction of Japan. \"",

    "storyline": "Tomba! is set on a group of islands in the middle of an ocean which do not appear on any map. Formed with great provinces in the north and smaller islands in the south, the region is home to peaceful people who lived in tranquility for many years. The island was once a beautiful place, home to birds and plantations.\n\nThe protagonist is an energetic pink-haired youngster named Tomba (Tombi in Europe). One day, seven evil pigs appeared, and using their magical powers, they mutated the surroundings into a bizarre landscape. The underlings of The Evil Pigs, called the Koma Pigs, stole Tomba\u0027s grandfather\u0027s bracelet and a substantial amount of gold through a strange lust for it.\n\nTomba\u0027s quest is to fetch his bracelet, which requires trapping the Evil Pigs along the way. Trapping them involves finding the Evil Pig Bags, which are keys to entering each realm of each Evil Pig. He must also complete missions for other people to get items and the Evil Pig Bags. Some side-missions are purely for fun and irrelevant to the main storyline.",
    "summary": "Tomba! is a side-scrolling platformer in which players control Tomba, a wild boy on the search for his grandfather\u0027s bangle that was stolen by some evil pigs. Although Tomba is normally restricted to a two-dimensional plane, there are certain points where he can jump or climb onto a new plane. Tomba\u0027s main method of attack is to jump on top of enemies to grab them, allowing him to hop around on them before throwing them away. This can also be used to open other objects such as eggs or treasure chests. Tomba is also able to use various projectile weapons such as maces and boomerangs and can swing on branches and poles.\n\nThe game is based around a mission system, where the main character\u0027s (Tomba\u0027s) skills are employed to complete various tasks. Completion of a mission gives a certain amount of adventure points (AP) which are required for AP boxes which contain food (which gives you AP and restores 1 space of vitality) or items, and you may for example need 50,000 AP to open one. AP is also used to gain access to special places or information later in the game. Not all missions are necessary to progress in the game, however, they are required to achieve full completion. There are 130 events (missions) in the game, many of them rely on other events to be completed.",

Aeons ago the gods of Endoria were disgusted by the badness in the world and morphed themselves into crystal splinters and retreated into the underworld. Who gets all these splinters becomes the master of Endoria. Now two rival arch mages got aware of this myth and go on the search. You are one of them. \n \nOf course you have to dig deep into the underground to find them. Your responsibility lies in the building. managing and defending of mines. To achieve this you hire employees with different professions: Craftsmen, researchers, mine workers, hauliers and warriors. These people want to see money for their work and they improve their abilities when they become experienced. \n \nDuring the game you dig new alleys, equip them with traps, research new tools and fight against enemy troops to conquer their alleys. Later you have mutated creatures to your disposal. You spend most of your time on a map with hexagonal fields. There you issue orders and set the routes of your employees. \n \nThe in 1995 released CD-ROM version features speech, new background music and an online help. Additionally there is a \"light\" version of the game which tones down the complexity. \n \nThe PC version of Magic Endoria differs from the Commodore 64 version released the previous year in that it is real time instead of turn based.",

Inspired by \u002780s and \u002790s movies, comic books, as well as everything else that fits into the categories of \"iconic\" and \"pop culture\", it takes a humorous look at usually not-so-humorous themes. STORY: The world as we know is about to change - the united forces of demons, gods, and monsters prepare for another deadly attempt to eradicate \"the big guys\" and change the religious status quo. And, just perhaps, to drink lots of tea and discuss art in the meantime. The only one who can stop them is Bonaventura Horowitz - a snarky exorcist, who isn\u0027t exactly an angel himself. At the request of the Pope himself, Bon, accompanied by a group of his peculiar friends, sets off on a thrilling mission, leaving behind a trail of cigarette butts, empty whiskey bottles, and broken demonic hearts. FEATURES: • Quirky, fleshed out characters • Unique story, inspired by all the good stuff from pop culture • Comic-like aesthetics • Engaging exorcism system • Loads of sarcasm and humour • Pope on speed dial",

It’s a conversion of what most people know as Wonder Boy in Monster Land, and it’s as perfect a conversion as you’re likely to get. This game takes a different pace from the first Wonder Boy game, being more of an adventure with a slower pace and more strategy. You start the game with barely a thread on and are given a sword by some wise looking dude who lives in a tree - so far so good. It is then your task to travel through the various platform-based levels defeating monsters and evil bosses along the way. Each enemy you kill leaves behind a coin or money bag (these are also at various hidden locations if you jump at the right spot) and shops will offer you armour, shields, weaponry and go-faster shoes. You can also pop into a bar and top up your energy if you can afford it. Levels are time limited (shown by an egg-timer on the left) so you need to be quick, or energy is taken away from your heart meter.",

    "summary": "Tänzer is a homebrew action title inspired by games like Strider, OSman and Hagane: The Final Conflict, the art of Keita Amemiya and Roger Dean, and anime series like Guyver. The protagonist is a ballet dancer who is unexpectedly hit by a bright purple light at night in an apartment, just a week before the premiere of the ballet version of The Ariane. After the character wakes up the body is transformed and the world is in chaos. Each level has a different setting, ranging from the Old West to Ancient Rome. Levels are made up of several stages with mini bosses and then a large boss at the end of the level, acting as the guardian of that era.\n\nIn this 2D side-scrolling platformer the character can freely run left or right, jump and crouch. The jumping height is affected by how long the button is held down and jumping again provides a double and then a triple jump. Expert jumping can lead to an infinite amount of jumps because when an enemy is attacked while in the air, the counter is decreased so an additional jump can be performed. Enemies are engaged using six way fire with horizontal, vertical and diagonal slashes, and the attack button can be held for auto fire. Levels contain treasure chests with more gold, extra energy and other items. By destroying parts of the scenery secret pick-up items and stages can be discovered.\n\nDefeated enemies leave behind gold that can be forged into a transmutation ability, allowing for special attacks. The top right side of the screen shows the selected ability and how much the meter needed to perform it contains. In the pause menu a different ability can be selected. Forging abilities is done at the home base between levels, a space and time ship used to travel between time periods. Energy can also be replenished there through body repair. There are four abilities and they can be upgraded to make them more effective. At the home base it is also possible to forge a projectile weapon and the ability to save (but only while the game is active, the save disappears when the console is turned off).",

During that time scientists, dragons and inventors have tried to find a way to counter the mysterious deterioration of the portals - in vain. \n \nThe portal network has now totally collapsed and the islands are cut off from one another. The dragons and the Shaikan act as the only connection between the races, but even their resources are limited. \n \nNow, with the nations isolated from one another, a new nameless enemy strikes. Eo is completely at the mercy of the attackers ascending from demonic depths. \n \nIn the midst of this chaos a new hero appears. A simple Shaikan and a member of the hand, he searches desperately for answers to his deeply disturbing dreams. This search leads him to the ancestral home of his people, the Iron Fields, to the mountain of the Patriarch Ur. The elders can only tell him that his dreams are connected to his destiny, but nothing more. \n \nUpon arrival all he finds are more questions: Who are these demonic creatures the locals are calling the Nameless? What do the dragons know about the destiny of this world? \n \nAnd what has Professor Twiddles plan to restore the portals to do with all this? \n \nTo discover his destiny, our hero must acquire new skills and do battle with enemies new and old. But wherever he goes - the Nameless always seem to be a step ahead, and futile battles break out in which the hero holds the destiny of all of Eo in his hands.",

Constant abuse of power, coupled with in-fighting between members, ultimately led to their downfall, leaving the continent in ruins. During this massive upheaval, nearly every member of the group perished, sparing only seven, including their leader, Faust. \n \nUsing his last remnants of power, Faust saw a glimpse of the future and in his vision, saw once again the near annihilation of Nevareth due to the misuse of power. Now, nearly a thousand years after the sundering, that same evil has renewed and the cycle of extinction has begun. It is up to you to face the wake of destruction that begins to envelop Nevareth, and bring about its salvation.",
